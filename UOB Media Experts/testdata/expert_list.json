    "Research": "<p>Between 2003 and 2007 I took &lsquo;leave&rsquo; from French rural history in order to work on a project in the field of the cultural history of science and technology.

Together with colleagues in the Department of History, the Department of the History of Art, Birmingham City University and the Birmingham Assay Office, I organised the bicentenary conference on <a id=\"CMS_Abe20b67281ec426687da1820116769f8\" href=\"http:\/\/www.cbamh.bham.ac.uk\/matthew%20Boulton%20Conference%20Flyer.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Matthew Boulton<\/a>.

The current focus of my investigations is the circulation of industrial and agricultural &lsquo;know how&rsquo; between Britain, France, Germany and Scandinavia. <\/p> <h3>Past research<\/h3> <p>In 1976 I completed a doctorate on &lsquo;The Revolutionary Committees of the Department of the Aveyron&rsquo;, in other words a case-study of the French Revolutionary Terror. This study led me in the direction of more wide-ranging &nbsp;research into the ways in which traditional rural societies become politicised. A distillation of that research can be found in my monograph <font size=\"+0\"><em>Politics and Rural Society: the Southern Massif Central, c. 1750-1880<\/em> published by Cambridge University Press in 1985. The political engagement of country dwellers has been the abiding theme of my research activity over many years. It has resulted in a series of articles and books, the best known of which are two text books The Peasantry in the French Revolution (Cambridge, 1988) and The French Revolution, 1787-1804 (Longman Seminar Studies, 2003, revised and expanded edition 2009). <\/font><\/p> <p><font size=\"+0\">More recently, concern about the interpretive capacity of synthetic history-writing has prompted me to explore the methodology of comparative micro-history as a way of capturing the rich texture of country dwellers&rsquo; lives. This attempt to view the ordinary inhabitants of France from a fresh perspective resulted in a book entitled Liberty and Locality in Revolutionary France, 1760-1820: Six Villages Compared which was published by Cambridge University Press in 2003.<\/font> <\/p>",

    "Research": "Sensory processes and internal models for movement control.<br \/> <br \/> I am interested in anticipatory aspects of human movement control evident in tasks ranging from fine adjustments in grip when manipulating an object with the hands to whole body postural adjustments in keeping balanced when lifting an object while standing. Such actions are critically dependent on the orderly, coordinated recruitment of many muscles. However also important is the selection and integration of sensory information coming from visual, vestibular, and proprioceptive sources. This sensory input may be used as feedback to adjust movements that fail to attain their target. But the information also serves to correct inaccurate stored information about the environment and\/or the effector system, so reducing the likelihood of correction being required on another occasion. An important goal for research is to understand how the brain uses sensory input to develop and maintain accurate representations (internal models) for adaptive planning and control of movement. When we imagine an action, there is a feeling of it taking place that has a distinct time course; indeed it has been shown that the duration of imagined action is very similar to the corresponding real movement. It is conceivable that internal models that underlie overt movement contribute to imagining movement and current research asks whether imagined movement evolves in parallel with sensory induced changes in internal models.",

    "Research": "<strong>RESEARCH ACTIVITY <br \/> <br \/> <\/strong>Our research focuses on molecular and cellular mechanisms, which support the in vivo function of chemokines (chemotactic cytokines). Almost 50 different homologous human chemokines signal through 20 different cognate G-protein coupled receptors to elicit multiple cellular effects, most notably, cell migration. By this virtue, chemokines orchestrate intricate cellular moves and interactions, which are taking place during various pathophysiological processes ranging from fertilization and embryogenesis to, most conspicuously, immunity and inflammation. In addition, chemokines induce a broad spectrum of alternative cellular responses, including cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, senescence etc. Also, as recognized recently, they play a physiological role in brain function. Chemokines and their receptors are fundamental players in cancer development, growth and spread. They are involved in providing signals required for tumor cell survival, proliferation and migration and determine host-tumor interactions. The latter include angiogenesis and stromal reactions as well as immunity and tolerance to the emerging tumors. Recently a group of atypical chemokine receptors (also known as interceptors) emerged as powerful contributors to chemokine homeostasis and their functions in vivo. Currently interceptors include Duffy antigen, D6, CXCR7, CCRL1 and CCRL2. The unifying feature of Interceptors is their ability to internalize cognate chemokines in the absence of conventional G-protein mediated signaling. Chemokines acting through their receptors and modified by interactions with interceptors constitute building blocks of the largest coherently functioning intercellular communication system, the cell Esperanto.",

Following a year in Tanzania he completed his PhD at the University of Manchester focusing on the way in which congregations understand their worship, and spent five years doing church related community work in Manchester&rsquo;s eastern inner-city estates. Martin took up a lectureship in the sociology and anthropology of religion at Birmingham University in 1993 and has maintained a constant interest in Christian worship and the development of congregational studies in the UK. He founded and ran the Worship in Birmingham Project from 1998-2003. In October 2007 he was awarded a chair in Liturgical and Congregational Studies and has undertaken a number of significant managerial roles within the University. He is currently Deputy Pro-Vice Chancellor with responsibility for planning, staffing and community relations.&nbsp;",

    "IntroductoryStatement": "<p>I joined the University of Birmingham in 1993 as a Lecturer in the Sociology and Anthropology of Religion in the Department of Theology. My disciplinary home is Social Anthropology but I have always been excited by the possibilities of interdisciplinary work and have brought this to bear in my work on the study of Christian Worship and in the understanding of the nature of religious discourse within contemporary Britain. Much of my work, and that of my research students, has been based on the anthropological methods of ethnography and it is in this detailed and extended study of real life situations that I believe religion can be most fruitfully understood. More recently I have been working closely with colleagues in the Heritage and Cultural Learning Hub exploring the way in which text, performance and media environments intersect with, and reinterpret the nature of academic and religious discourses. I am also a co-lead for Religion and Culture within the Institute for Research into Superdiversity (IRiS).<\/p> <p>Since joining the University I have played an active role in the organisation and management of activities. I have been very actively involved on a national level with questions of academic quality and took up the role of Head of Department of Theology and Religion in 2002 and Head of the School of Philosophy, Theology and Religion in 2008. I have also acted as Head of the School of Historical Studies (2008) and Head of the College of Arts and Law (2010). My current role as Deputy Pro-Vice Chancellor includes responsibilities as Deputy to the Provost and Vice Principal including planning and human resources, and a leadership responsibility for community relations within the University.<\/p>",

    "IntroductoryStatement": "<p>Ian&rsquo;s career in sport psychology was stimulated through lifelong sport participation. His sport activities have included experience as an athlete and as a coach in sports such as hockey and endurance running. It was experiences such as these that led to him initiating a career that incorporated sport within it. A particular interest in sport psychology that developed during undergraduate studies for a Bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Sport Science at the University of Leeds led to subsequent study for a PhD in Sport Psychology at the University of Birmingham. Here Ian focussed on his main research interest which centres on the investigation of prosocial and antisocial behaviour in sport, and the psychological processes involved in promoting such behaviours. More recently Ian has developed a particular interest in how such processes may influence use of performance enhancing drugs in sport and exercise participants. Ian has further research interests in coaching efficacy and effectiveness and how athletes' perceptions of these may affect athletes' cognitions, emotions, and behaviour.<\/p>",

    "Biography": "<p>Dr Jim Reynolds was born in Northampton and remained in the Midlands where he attended school in Warwick before studying Biology at the University of Southampton. He carried out applied graduate work (MScF) in the Faculty of Forestry at the University of Toronto where he was a rarity studying wildlife of boreal forests rather than the &lsquo;crop&rsquo; itself. He returned to the UK and to graduate work (DPhil) at the University of Oxford where his interests in nutritional ecology and physiology grew. He then returned to North America to apply his interests in foraging ecology to the conservation of a Federally Threatened bird species in the southern USA. Although he continues to collaborate on this Florida Scrub-Jay (<em>Aphelocoma coerulescens<\/em>) project, he is now a lecturer in ornithology and animal conservation at Birmingham.&nbsp;<\/p>",
    "Description": "Dr Jim Reynolds has worked on the reproductive biology and the nutritional ecology of birds from many different and diverse orders including passerines, geese, grouse, kingfishers and terns. He has worked in North America and in mainland Europe in investigating how human activity influences food availability and the resulting changes in avian reproductive investment and life histories. He employs state of the art technologies and traditional methods in field ornithology in spear heading research into the foraging ecology of free-living birds in the UK, in the UK's Overseas Territories and elsewhere.",

He continues to study further aspects of nutrient-limited reproduction in small passerines. Current research examines the influences of food supplementation on various reproductive parameters of garden and woodland birds, including timing of laying, clutch size, chick growth and survival, fledging success and mid and long-term survival (e.g. recruitment to the breeding population), and investigations of the energetic investment of reproductive phases.<\/p> <p>He is also examining the functional significance of pigmentation patterns of eggshells (with Dr Phill Cassey at the University of Adelaide, and Dr Vallo Tilgar and Prof. Raivo M&auml;nd at the University of Tartu, Estonia).

    "Teaching": "<p>Dr Reynolds teaches on three years of the undergraduate programme with a particular emphasis on the reproductive biology, physiology, ecology and behaviour of birds.<\/p> <p>He is Module Leader for the first-year animal biology course BIO145 (Introduction to Evolution and Animal Biology), and he also lectures on BIO234 (Ecology), BIO372 (Conservation Biology) and BIO392 (Advanced Topics in Animal Behaviour).<\/p> <p>Furthermore, Dr Reynolds runs a final-year module to south-central Florida when students collect data on endangered fauna for their honours projects.<\/p> <p>Dr Reynolds&rsquo; teaching employs the theoretical and practical approaches that he employs in his research, allowing students to understand how investigations are founded in good biological understanding and that techniques that have been established for decades can still generate data that are useful and progress our knowledge in key subject areas. This is at the heart of his teaching philosophy where students should have a good grounding in theoretical and applied components of core ecological and behavioural principles in order to call themselves whole animal biologists.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>",

    "Biography": "I did an undergraduate degree in Biology at the University of Sussex followed by a PhD in how plant roots grow at University College of North Wales, Bangor. In my research career I have worked in the US, Germany, Scotland and back in Wales on projects related to the adaptive response of plants to changing environments.",
    "Description": "I am a senior lecturer in Biology at the University of Birmingham. My research career started with roots in Wales and currently focuses on aphids in Birmingham with stops in the USA, New Zealand and Europe in between. My teaching spans field ecology through to plant functional genomics. As a card-carrying Darwinist I am involved in teaching evolution at all levels from primary school to the U3A. As an admissions tutor I am concerned about the opening fault line at the secondary tertiary boundary. Increasingly obsessed with skills, I have developed resources to help teachers and learners at all levels.  My favourite thing is phloem and I badger the public about it (and Darwin) at every opportunity.",

    "Research": "<p>By training I am a plant physiologist, but like most biologists, the recent rise of genetic technologies has revolutionised my research, so that now I also work in the more molecular areas.<\/p><p>My core research is aimed at understanding how plants regulate the transport of water, sugars and salts. Like the human genome, the genetic information of many plants has been sequenced, but like humans we know very little about what the all the DNA does. To find out, we genetically modify plants to understand the function of the different genes.&nbsp;Our work has many applications, from producing agricultural plants that are more tolerant of salt and drought, through to those that are less palatable to herbivores such as aphids.<\/p><p>Research Theme within School of Biosciences: Organisms and Environment<\/p><h3>Understanding plants in changing environments<\/h3><p>We are interested in the physiological and biochemical processes which control plant growth at both cellular and whole plant level, and how changes in the environment alter this. We are interested in how the composition of plant compartments such as the xylem and phloem are regulated.<\/p><p>Our interest in the phloem in particular has developed our research into the area of plant - insect interaction as model systems to study defence against herbivores and other pathogens. Sap feeding pests such as aphids are predicted to become more important as climate change accelerates so novel control methods will be needed &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; one strategy is to modifying phloem composition to determine its effect on aphids.<\/p><p>Techniques for the measurement of turgor, osmotic pressure and solutes in single cells are central. Additionally, the use of specific insects allows access to phloem (aphid stylectomy) and xylem (spittle bugs). We use molecular techniques to analyse environmentally (stress) induced changes in gene expression (RT-PCR and transcriptomics). Candidate genes are investigated using gene knockout mutants in <em>Arabidopsis<\/em> to determine the role of individual genes in a range of biotic and abiotic interactions.<\/p><p>We have had going collaborations with industry including Syngenta in the area of plant insect interaction and Humber VHB in projects aiming to optimise nutrient transport in greenhouse grown crops.<\/p>",

    "Biography": "<p>I joined the University of Birmingham in 2012 as an Academic Practice Advisor in the Centre for Learning and Academic Development (CLAD), teaching on a range of academic development programmes and providing advice and support to Schools and Colleges on teaching and learning issues. In 2013 I took up my current role as Assistant Director (Educational Development) in the recently-merged CLAD and Learning Spaces, assuming responsibility for coordinating the academic development and educational enhancement activities of the Division.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>I started my academic career in Philosophy, completing my PhD on the nature of rationality alongside a range of visiting lecturer duties at the Universities of Sunderland and Durham (1997-2001) before taking up a lectureship post (2001-2002). Although tempted into academia by the challenges of research, somewhat to my surprise I found teaching equally stimulating and rewarding - so, when the opportunity arose to take up the newly-created role of Subject Coordinator for Philosophy at the UK-wide Learning and Teaching Support Network (later part of the Higher Education Academy), I decided to give it a try. Thus, almost by stealth, began my new career in educational development.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>My tenure at the Subject Centre for Philosophical and Religious Studies (2002-2011) involved working with academics and departments across the UK, both within these subjects and across sometimes surprising disciplinary boundaries - e.g. working with geography and business colleagues to explore differences and similarities in conceptions of graduate employability; or with law, bioscience and medicine to share good practice in the teaching of ethics. It also gave me an opportunity to be part of sector-wide debates and developments in UK HE, for example working with organisations such as Vitae to enhance support and development opportunities for postgraduate researchers as students, teaching assistants, and tomorrow&rsquo;s academics.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>Throughout my career I have been interested to connect theories, policies and practices; and to explore the insights, benefits and challenges to be found at the intersection of different disciplines.<\/p>",

    "Biography": "<p>Matt Sherlock has held a variety of roles in Higher Education, and more broadly the education sector. Having studied Chemistry at the University of Birmingham, he went on to undertake a laboratory technician role at a college of Further Education. The experience working with students and supporting educationalists inspired Matt to undertake a postgraduate qualification in teaching, working in a variety of secondary schools across the midlands.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>Having built an appreciation for pedagogy and knowledge transfer Matt then went on to diverge into IT and audio visual support, working within the learning resources accommodation team at the University of Birmingham. His involvement in developing and implementing IT support and rollout of teaching clusters at the University provided Matt with the necessary IT skills to move into a Network and information Systems management role within a thriving secondary School &ndash; Kind Edwards. Here Matt was involved in the rollout of a new student record system, broadening engagement with staff, students and parents using available educational technologies.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>Matt moved back to his alma mater when he joined Academic Services in 2006 as a development officer in timetabling, exams and congregations. Here Matt was involved in process analysis and development, introducing seating plans for centrally managed exams, development of underpinning databases to support graduation and examinations and embark on a transformative project to bring integrated timetabling across the University using one system.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>From here, Matt has been involved in a number of transformative projects and initiatives within Academic Services. He has set up a thriving project support team, supported the implementation of centralised timetabling and module evaluation systems across the University. He has recently been involved in introducing Canvas, a state of the art virtual learning environment across the University. His experience in project management and educational strategies has allowed Matt to broaden his remit into management of learning spaces development across the University. Here he managed an annual spend of &pound;2-3million transforming and maintaining the University&rsquo;s large portfolio of generic teaching spaces, from large lecture theatre through to informal study spaces and group seminar rooms.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>Matt now seeks to seamlessly mesh both physical and virtual learning spaces and educational technologies across the university&rsquo;s learning environs.<\/p>",

    "Biography": "<p>Pete Watkins studied Physics at the University of Birmingham and obtained his PhD in Particle Physics after working on bubble chamber experiments at CERN. These&nbsp;experiments discovered many short-lived hadrons which we now know contain quarks. These collision energies were around one thousand times smaller than he now studies in the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider(LHC).<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>He worked on the first experiment to publish results from the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron and when this accelerator was converted into a proton antiproton collider he worked on the Nobel prize winning UA1 experiment.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>This discovered the W and Z bosons and he wrote a book 'Story of the W and Z' aimed at a general audience.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>He wrote much of the software with a few colleagues to visualise the matter-antimatter collisions which aided the first identification of the massive bosons.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>Detailed measurements of the W and Z bosons were made by later experiments at the Large Electron Positron Collider(LEP) where he worked on the OPAL experiment. Here the Birmingham team constructed the 12m by 12m muon&nbsp;detectors and electronics which selected (or triggered) the recording of the most interesting collisions and analysed the recorded data.&nbsp;<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>For the past decade he has been working on the&nbsp;calorimeter trigger, event visualisation and physics analysis for the ATLAS experiment. Most recently contributing to the publication of the chib3p observation which was the first new particle discovered at the LHC.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>Peter was the head of the Birmingham Particle Physics group for many years. He is the ATLAS UK Outreach coordinator and the UK representative on the International Particle Physics Outreach Group.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>He has initiated many different Outreach activities and competitions throughout his career and gives many talks each year on Particle Physics and the LHC aimed at a&nbsp;non-specialist audience.<\/p>",

    "Research": "<p>Dr. Elliott&rsquo;s research investigates how we use sensory information to time and synchronise our movements. These can be 'automatic' everyday movements such as walking or nodding our head along to a song; or those which are more complicated, such as a musician playing in an orchestra or a dancer performing complex choreographed movements.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>He has recently investigated how the brain integrates multisensory timing information when people are synchronising movements to repetitive events or rhythms. This research has led to the development of Bayesian models that allow estimation of the expected timing errors in movements based on the statistics of the sensory events being synchronised with. This research was funded by the BBSRC in the UK.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>He is now investigating how people synchronise actions when moving together as a group. It is known that people can be influenced by others in their actions and indeed on occasions find themselves moving in synchrony with another person (e.g. when walking). In some situations group synchrony can cause problems. For example, the famous Millenium Bridge issue in London, where large scale synchrony of movements led to extreme interactions with the bridge&rsquo;s structure. His current work is investigating what sensory information is required that leads to a group of individuals becoming synchronised. In particular, he is interested how the brain combines visual timing information from each member of the group as a cue for one&rsquo;s own movement. The models produced in this research will be done in collaboration with the Vibration Research Group at Sheffield University. It is hoped these models will allow more advanced bridge and stadium structures to be designed. This research is being funded by the EPSRC in the UK.<\/p>",

    "Research": "<h3>Atlantic Canadian literary culture<\/h3>\u000d\u000a<p>My fascination with reading, writing and publishing communities in the Atlantic region of Canada began with my PhD - research that was expanded for my book, <em>Writing the Everyday: Women&rsquo;s Textual Communities in Atlantic Canada<\/em> (McGill-Queen&rsquo;s UP, 2004). There, I explore how and why communities form around texts that record women&rsquo;s everyday realities, histories, and traditions.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>My interest in popular, non-canonical writing is informed by feminist standpoint epistemology (see, for example, my articles in Women&rsquo;s Studies International Forum 2002b and Atlantis 1999a) - a theoretical approach that has shaped my investigation of textual communities, leading me to combine qualitative interviewing with studies of publishing history, social contexts, textual analysis and, most importantly, close attention to the local histories and oral cultures that many Atlantic writers draw upon in their work (evident in the poetry of Maxine Tynes, see 1999b below; and 2006).<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>My research has developed into a consideration of the reception of &ldquo;best-selling&rdquo; Atlantic Canadian books and films beyond their most immediate communities (2007d; 2008a). In my essay &ldquo;Strange Terrain&rdquo; (Essays in Canadian Writing, 2004), for example, I consider how two writers engage with place-myths about Newfoundland that circulate trans-nationally.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p><iframe src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/VgJlYs_KTf8\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"500\" height=\"314\">&nbsp;<\/iframe><\/p>\u000d\u000a<ul>\u000d\u000a<li>Transcript<\/li>\u000d\u000a<\/ul>\u000d\u000a<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\u000d\u000a<h3>Reading communities and cultures of reading in the USA, Canada and UK<\/h3>\u000d\u000a<p>&ldquo;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.beyondthebookproject.org\/\">Beyond the Book: Mass Reading Events and Contemporary Cultures of Reading in the UK, USA and Canada<\/a>&rdquo;&nbsp;was an ambitious interdisciplinary trans-Atlantic investigation ofshared reading events, which was funded for 3 years by the AHRC (2005-8) and undertaken in collaboration with DeNel Rehberg Sedo (Mount Saint Vincent University, Canada), a communications scholar with expertise on book groups.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>A pilot fieldwork study with readers participating in a &ldquo;One Book, One Community&rdquo; program in Kitchener\/Waterloo\/Cambridge (Canada) and with the agencies involved in the organisation of &ldquo;One Book, One Chicago&rdquo; was completed in October 2004, part-funded by the British Academy. This research is informed by my previous work on textual communities and my interest in issues of democratic access to cultural production and literature pursued via my guest editorship of Women&rsquo;s Studies International Forum (2002) and a co-authored article on the export of Canadian Literature (2000). It also builds upon my commitment to research methodologies that combine empirical and textual approaches to the study of literary cultures (e.g. 2007c; 2008b; 2009a).<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>The capstone publication for the project is&nbsp;a&nbsp;monograph co-written with DeNel Rehberg Sedo, <em><a id=\"CMS_A22f30d29f9324362b34f7f19df84d689\" title=\"book order page\" href=\"http:\/\/www.routledge.com\/books\/details\/9780415532952\/\">Reading Beyond the Book: The Social Practices of Contemporary Literary Culture<\/a> <\/em>(Routledge, 2013).

    "Biography": "<p>A social historian with a national profile, Professor Chinn is also a broadcaster, newspaper columnist, public speaker, writer, charity fundraiser and campaigner for the rights of working-class people and the recognition of the importance of manufacturing. Professor Chinn is the author of 29 books that include studies of working-class housing, urban working class life, working-class women&rsquo;s lives, manufacturing, Birmingham, the Black Country, and ethnic minorities.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>He has appeared as an expert on various television programmes, including Channel 4&rsquo;s &lsquo;History Hunters&rsquo; with Tony Robinson and BBC 4&rsquo;s &lsquo;Edwardian Larder&rsquo;. In the Midlands he is a long-running columnist on local history for the Express and Star and the Birmingham Mail; he has a weekly local history show on BBC WM and regular history slots on BBC Midlands Today; and he was the expert on ITV&rsquo;s &lsquo;The Way We Were&rsquo; series.&nbsp;Professor Chinn has appeared on numerous Radio 4 programmes, including those presented by Libby Purvess and Laurie Taylor. More recently he presented the series &lsquo;Centre of Our World&rsquo;, looking at various ethnic minorities in Birmingham, and &lsquo;Manufacturing Matters&rsquo; a polemic for manufacturing on &lsquo;The World Tonight&rsquo;.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>Professor Chinn&rsquo;s broadcasting and writing on housing, working-class life, poverty, women, ethnic minorities, and the importance of manufacturing is deeply affected by his family&rsquo;s working-class background and life in the back-to-backs of Birmingham. This affinity led him to take a prominent role in the campaign to save the last back to backs in Birmingham and turn them into a National Trust Museum. Professor Chinn also featured strongly in the fight to ensure the re-opening of Birmingham&rsquo;s Town Hall, in the drive for a memorial to the paupers who died in Birmingham Workhouse, and in the campaign for a fitting memorial for the victims of the Blitz in Birmingham. He has been an active supporter of the Birmingham St Patrick&rsquo;s Parade and is chairman of the Birmingham St George&rsquo;s Day Association, which has led the way in celebrating England and Englishness in a positive and embracing way.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>An ardent supporter of manufacturing, Professor Chinn was a key figure in the battle to keep the Longbridge car factory open in 2001 and has since been supported the struggle for jobs at Chubb, Alstom, HP Sauce, and Smith and Nephew.&nbsp;<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>Throughout his work in the community, his overarching aim has been to push across the belief that each and every person has made their mark upon history and that each and every person has a story to tell &ndash; not only about themselves but also about their people who came before them. Professor Chinn believes passionately that history must be democratised and that the lives of supposedly &lsquo;ordinary&rsquo; people matter because the people themselves matter. To these ends his work has focused upon those who too often have been excluded from or marginalised by formal history: the working class, especially the poor; women; and ethnic minorities.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>Crucially he feels that people should tell their own stories and not have them mediated through the words of others. Those stories can be told in many ways &ndash; whether it be in letters, poems, life stories, creative writing, photographs, paintings, drawings, recordings or videos.&nbsp;This local, community and family history has a two-fold social purpose in modern society. First, through an awareness of our own past and that of others we can bring people together, recognising the commonality of human experiences through our own lives and stories and those of others who may appear to be different to us. Second, an understanding of the past can provide a vital bond of continuity for young people living in a perpetually changing world, giving them a sense of place and belonging and an appreciation of the fact that the rights we now enjoy were gained through the hardships of those that came before.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>For many years Professor Chinn has received letters and photos from Brummies across the world. They are gathered now in the BirminghamLives Archive, which contains over 40,000 letters, hundreds of life stories, thousands of interviews, cine film, tens of thousands of photos and a wealth of memorabilia. Together they make up probably the biggest collection of working-class life history for any one place in the world. At present Professor Chinn is in discussions with Birmingham Archives and Heritage about handing over this priceless collection to the City - so long as it is made accessible.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>A keen supporter of local charities and good causes, for which he has raised hundreds of thousands of pounds in the West Midlands, he has also helped build homes for orphans in Romania and more recently volunteered on renovating a school in the Andes in Ecuador. In 2001 Professor Chinn was awarded the MBE for his services to local history and to local charities<\/p>",

    "Biography": "<p>Ian is a Chartered Geologist and a former Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society. His research on geochemical aspects of earth surface processes and systems commenced in 1990 and has encompassed climatic, glacial, karstic and experimental themes, complementing a longer-standing interest in carbonates and ice ages in deep time. His academic career started with undergraduate study of geology at Nottingham (BSc 1974) before undertaking research on sedimentology of Scottish metasediments (PhD 1978). During his PhD studies he took up a demonstratorship at Cambridge in January 1977 before being appointed lecturer in Sedimentology at Birmingham in June 1980. After promotion to Senior Lecturer in 1993, he moved to Keele University in January 1996 as Professor of Earth Surface Processes. He was successively a Head of Department (1998-2001) and Dean of the Faculty of Natural Sciences and member of the University&rsquo;s senior management team (2001-2003) at Keele.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>He returned to the University of Birmingham in September 2003 as Professor of Physical Geography and became retitled Professor of Geosystems in 2010 reflecting his change of academic leadership responsibilities. Ian has been the Chief Editor of the&nbsp;<em>Journal of the Geological Society<\/em>&nbsp;(1996-2000) and an Editor of&nbsp;<em>Reviews of Geophysics<\/em>&nbsp;(2005-2010). He has much experience with the Natural Environmental Research Council&nbsp;and was a member of the sub-panel for Earth Systems and Environmental Sciences in the Research Excellence Framework 2014. He was Head of the School of Geography, Earth and Environmental Sciences at Birmingham for the calendar years 2012 and 2013. He currently works part-time.<\/p>",

A key mechanism to prevent inbreeding is self-incompatibility (SI), which is a controlled by a single, multi-allelic S-locus. Incompatible (\"self\") pollen is rejected and compatible (\"non-self\") pollen is allowed to fertilize the plant.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>My lab is investigating the signalling cascades, targets and mechanisms regulating pollen tube tip growth inhibition induced by SI in <em>Papaver<\/em>. The \"self\" interaction triggers a Ca<sup>2+<\/sup>-dependent signalling network, resulting in incompatible pollen tube tip growth being inhibited and programmed cell death being induced. Our long-term goal is to establish how the different components integrate and interact in what has turned out to be a complex signalling network. Currently research falls into several areas:<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p><strong>1. Investigations into programmed cell death in the SI response.<\/strong><\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>Programmed cell death (PCD) is an important mechanism responsible for the controlled death of targeted cells in animal and plant cells. We demonstrated that PCD is triggered in incompatible pollen and identified several caspase-like activities (a VEIDase and a LEVDase) that are activated by an incompatible SI response. We identified increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) during SI-PCD and are currently investigating their role in incompatible pollen using a mass spectrometry approach. We are exploring further mechanisms involved in PCD with <a title=\"Dr Maurice Bosch profile\" href=\"http:\/\/www.aber.ac.uk\/en\/ibers\/staff\/mub\/\">Dr Maurice Bosch<\/a> (IBERS).<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p><img style=\"margin: 0px 0px 8px 12px; float: right;\" src=\"\/Images\/College-LES-only\/biosciences\/staff-research\/veft2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"253\" \/><\/p>\u000d\u000a<p><strong>2. Alterations in the actin cytoskeleton <\/strong><\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>In many cells alterations to the cytoskeleton are the first visible response to extracellular stimuli. We have shown that both the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton are important target for SI signals, and recently obtained evidence for crosstalk between actin and microtubules. In animal cells sustained actin depolymerization can stimulate apoptosis via caspases. We have shown that actin depolymerization can trigger PCD in pollen and propose that the formation of highly stable punctate actin foci is integral to SI-PCD. The actin-binding proteins cyclase-associated protein (CAP) and actin depolymerizing factor (ADF) key downstream targets of SI-PCD and co-localize to the foci.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p><strong>3. Analysis of phosphorylation of soluble inorganic pyrophosphatases (sPPases) <\/strong><\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>We previously identified soluble inorganic pyrophosphatases (sPPases) as a novel target for phosphorylation, as Pr-p26.1a\/b was phosphorylated after SI.We are analysing the phosphorylation sites on Pr-p26.1a\/b using mass spectrometry and using site-directed mutagenesis to attempt to establish those involved in sPPase phospho-regulation. We are also analysing the CDPK(s) involved in SI-induced phosphorylation of Pr-p26.1a\/b.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p><strong>4.<\/strong> <strong>Analysis of SI-induced acidification<\/strong><\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>We previously observed a major acidification of the pollen cytosol during PCD in incompatible pollen.&nbsp; We recently measured temporal alterations in cytosolic pH ([pH]<sub>cyt<\/sub>); they were surprisingly rapid, reaching pH 6.4 within 10 min of SI induction, stabilizing by 60 min at pH 5.5. Exploring the role of this, we found that the [pH]<sub>cyt<\/sub> acidification is an integral and essential event for SI-induced PCD. We demonstrated that [pH]<sub>cyt<\/sub> acidification is necessary and sufficient for triggering several key hallmark features of the SI-PCD signalling pathway, notably the activation of a DEVDase\/caspase-3-like activity and formation of SI-induced punctate actin foci.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p><strong>5. Integrating signals and targets involved in mediating SI-PCD in incompatible pollen <\/strong>It has become evident that many of the PCD events are intertwined. Current focus is on understanding the mechanisms involved. The long-term goal is to establish how the different components integrate and interact in what has turned out to be a complex signalling network.&nbsp;<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p><img class=\"centredBlock\" src=\"\/Images\/College-LES-only\/biosciences\/staff-research\/franklin-tong-mediating-SI-PCD-incompatible-pollen.gif\" alt=\"Integrating signals and targets involved in mediating SI-PCD in incompatible pollen \" width=\"510\" height=\"297\" \/><\/p>\u000d\u000a<p><strong>6. Investigating the functionality of Papaver S-determinants in heterologous systems<\/strong><\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>We recently showed that the pollen <em>S<\/em>-determinant, <em>PrpS<\/em> could be expressed in compatible <em>Arabidopsis thaliana<\/em>, a self-compatible model plant. Exposing transgenic <em>A. thaliana<\/em> pollen to recombinant <em>Papaver <\/em>PrsS protein triggered remarkably similar responses to those observed in incompatible <em>Papaver <\/em>pollen. This demonstrated that PrpS is functional in a species with no SI system that diverged ~140 million years ago, and suggests that the <em>Papaver<\/em> SI system uses cellular targets that are, perhaps, common to all eudicots and that endogenous signaling components can be recruited to elicit a response that most likely never operated in this species. We are currently exploring if the <em>Papaver S<\/em>-determinants are functional in other plant species\/genera and also if they work in other cell types.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p><strong>7. We are pursuing possible commercial aspects of using SI, by investigating whether poppy SI can be transferred to other species in collaboration with <a title=\"Dr Barend de Graaf\" href=\"http:\/\/www.cardiff.ac.uk\/biosi\/contactsandpeople\/stafflist\/a-d\/degraaf-barend-dr-overview_new.htm\">Dr Barend de Graaf<\/a> (Cardiff) and <a title=\"Dr Wendy Harwood\" href=\"https:\/\/www.jic.ac.uk\/staff\/wendy-harwood\/research.htm\">Dr Wendy Harwood<\/a> (JIC).<\/strong> This follows on from filing a patent in 2008.

He received his PhD in 1995 for work into the private equity market.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In 1999, Chris became a lecturer in the Business School, becoming Senior Lecturer in 2005 and Reader in 2011. Since 1999, he has been Programme Director of the MBA in Strategy and Procurement Management, Head of the Procurement and Operations Management Group and Programme Director of the UG Business Management degrees. In 2008, he was awarded honorary fellowship of the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply, FCIPS. In&nbsp;2012, he won the University \/ Guild&nbsp;Outstanding Personal Tutor Award.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Over the years, Chris has worked with a number of public and private sector organisations including the Department for Education and Skills, the Department of Health \/ NHS (2001 to date), IBM (1998-2007), Interbrew and Rolls Royce. He is also a long-standing lecturer on the Business School's Executive MBA programmes and HSMC's Executive MSc programmes.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Chris has also been successful in attracting research funding. In 2001, he was the joint-recipient of a &pound;338,000 EPSRC grant for research into buyer-supplier relationships. In 2002, he was the joint-recipient of a &pound;75,041 contract&nbsp;with the Oxford Radcliffe NHS Hospital Trust for research into organisational buying behaviour. In 2007, he was the joint-recipient of an &pound;99,901&nbsp;ESRC grant for research into temporary employment in the UK public sector. In 2010,&nbsp;he&nbsp;was&nbsp;the joint-recipient of an EREBUS CASE studentship&nbsp;concerning&nbsp;public sector&nbsp;procurement. In 2013, he was the joint-recipient of a &pound;90,460 NHS NIHR grant for research into NHS commissioning.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">All of these research projects have yielded a high number of publications (see list below), many in internationally leading journals such as <em>Public Administration<\/em>, the <em>British Journal of Industrial Relations<\/em> and <em>Work, Employment and Society. <\/em>Chris has also contributed to studies undertaken by the National Audit Office and the Treasury Select Committee.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Chris's current research activities focus upon NHS commissioning, public sector contracting, buyer-supplier relationships, trust and opportunism in business markets, the promotion of innovation through public procurement, the procurement of professional services and organisational buying behaviour. Chris also retains an interest in political science, with a particular focus upon the politics of state-finance relations and modern political philosophy.<\/p>",

    "Biography": "<p>It was during my PhD studies on TB, under the guidance of Professor David E. Minnikin [Newcastle University], that I developed a thirst for research and realised that if one was to tackle fundamental biological problems, then a multidisciplinary approach would be needed. As a result, on completing my PhD in Chemistry, I undertook a period of post-doctoral training under the direction of Professor Patrick J. Brennan [Colorado State University]. This allowed me to expand my TB research capabilities into the areas of detailed biochemistry and molecular biology.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>It was during this \"tour abroad\" that my career began to flourish: I became established as an independent researcher and continued my academic training at Colorado State University, extending further my interests into TB immunopathogenesis and the novel area of non peptide-based antigens. It was during the period 1993-1998 that my research really took off through the award of several substantial programme grants from the National Institutes of Health, USA. I decided to return to the UK in the summer of 1998 due to family commitments and accepted a position as Reader at Newcastle University. Whilst maintaining my strong collaborations in the USA, this move allowed me to establish a number of additional exciting new collaborative ventures in the UK and Europe. In 2002, I moved to The University of Birmingham to the Bardrick Research Chair of Microbial Physiology and Chemistry within the School of Biosciences.<\/p>",

    "Research": "<p>Research Theme within School of Biosciences:Molecular and Cell Biology<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>We (GSB) have contributed over the past several years in understanding the characteristics of the cell wall of TB, which has been the site of action of a number of front-line TB agents. We have now opted for a broader strategy: identification of new drug targets and drug development (with Professor Minnikin); vaccine development; identification of mechanisms of intracellular survival, replication and pathogenesis; definition of the fundamental genome of the tubercle bacillus, its phenotype and the functionality of the phenotypic characteristics through derivation of mutants.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>It is a widely held view that efforts to relieve the disease burden imposed by tuberculosis must benefit from concerted attempts to understand the basic biochemistry of the organism, particularly in view of the current availability genomic data from the M. Tuberculosis genome. Thus, providing a timely insight into these remarkable bacteria and several novel areas of mycobacterial cell wall physiology<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p><strong>The cell wall of Mycobacterium tuberculosis: A focus for new drug targets and vaccines<\/strong><\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>There has been no significant decrease in worldwide mortality due to tuberculosis (TB) since before the time of Koch; the advent of sanatoria and chemotherapy, which drastically reduced TB in the more developed countries, has had no profound effect on the global problem. The reasons for the transient increase have been well documented: the HIV\/AIDS epidemic, increased immigration and transmission from high-prevalence countries, and the emergence of multi-drug resistant strains of TB.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>I am internationally recognised for my work in <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis<\/em> cell wall physiology. I have contributed to many areas of this field including, microbial pathogenesis, mechanisms of antibiotic resistance and drug development. More specifically, I have been involved in the structural elucidation of a number of glycolipids from mycobacteria, such as the phenolic glycolipid of <em>M. haemophilum<\/em>; the acylated trehaloses of <em>M. tuberculosis<\/em> H37Rv; the lipooligosaccharides from <em>M. gordonae<\/em> and the glycopeptidolipids of <em>M. xenopi<\/em> and <em>M. senegalense<\/em>. I have <em>extended<\/em> our knowledge of the mycolyl-arabinogalactan complex from <em>M. tuberculosis<\/em> and have obtained a more <em>sophisticated impression<\/em> of the primary and secondary relationship of these entities.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>More recently, my research interests have also included:<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>i) the biosynthesis and molecular basis of mycolic acids, glycoproteins, and the complex polysaccharides, arabinogalactan and lipoarabinomannan, which has resulted in the development of new acyltransferase and glycosyltransferase assays, and the identification of key intermediates and characterisation of new products resulting from enzymic synthesis;<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>ii) the isolation and molecular characterisation of <em>M. tuberculosis<\/em> cell wall mutants, generated through either chemical or genetic means, which has allowed me to evaluate the role of various cell wall structures as virulence determinants;<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>iii) the mode of action of anti-tuberculosis drugs, such as isoniazid, ethionamide, thiolactomycin and ethambutol, which has resulted in the identification of resistance genes and the structural elucidation of secondary metabolites;<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>and finally iv) the synthesis of custom-designed antagonists against <em>M. tuberculosis<\/em>. For instance, one of my early key achievements, which was <em>ground-breaking<\/em> in this area of research, was published in <strong><em>Science<\/em><\/strong>:the identification of the major excreted protein antigen [antigen 85] as a key mycolyltransferase enzyme involved in the biogenesis of the cell wall of <em>M. tuberculosis<\/em>.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>In a second research strand, I have been at the forefront in the discovery of <em>M. tuberculosis<\/em> T-cell antigens and the CD1 antigen presentation pathway. For instance, the initial identification of glucose monomycolate (GMM) as a CD1b-presented glycolipid and its precise structural requirements, antigen processing and presentation to CD1b-restricted T cells were <em>key<\/em> discoveries published in <strong><em>Science<\/em><\/strong>, <strong><em>EMBO<\/em><\/strong> <strong><em>J<\/em><\/strong>. and <strong><em>Nature Immunology<\/em><\/strong>.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>More recently, I have described in <em>ground-breaking<\/em> articles published in <strong><em>Nature<\/em><\/strong> and <strong><em>Journal of Experimental Medicine<\/em><\/strong> that the T-cell antigen receptor, CD1c protein-mediated recognition is governed by a family of <em>M. tuberculosis<\/em> glycolipids. My research continues to extend significantly the state of the art in both research areas. At the same time I have bridged several research disciplines to set the research agenda in the biosynthesis of the mycobacterial cell wall and the CD1 field, which is evidenced by the quality of my internationally refereed papers, significant funding in the form of several long-term Programme Grants, and ability to attract first-rate international Research Fellows and PhD students.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>My research has also been recognised by the award of several prizes (<em>e.g<\/em>. the W.H. Pierce Memorial Prize from the Society for Applied Microbiology; the Carbohydrate Chemistry Award from the Royal Society of Chemistry; Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award; the internationally <em>prestigious<\/em> Biochemical Society Award), and numerous plenary lecture invitations (<em>e.g.<\/em> Keystone Research Conferences)<\/p>",

Working with <em>Escherichia coli<\/em> K-12, over the past 25 years, the lab has elucidated some of the basic rules of promoter recognition by RNA polymerase and some of the fundamental mechanisms by which transcription activators function (see reviews listed below).<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>The work with RNA polymerase has focused on the roles of the alpha and sigma subunits, whilst the work on transcription activation has developed from studies of the cyclic AMP receptor protein (known as CRP or CAP), which have established a paradigm for understanding transcription activation in bacteria. Early work with CRP, and with the related activator, FNR was concerned with simple promoters, such as the <em>E. coli lac<\/em> or <em>gal<\/em> promoters, where one molecule of activator is sufficient for full induction. Recently, the lab has turned its attention to more complicated promoters that are regulated by many different factors. Because bacterial gene expression is exquisitely sensitive to the environment, the majority of promoters are complex and the lab has focused on cases where one molecule of activator is insufficient for full induction.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>The work has identified two distinct and novel mechanisms for co-activation of a promoter by multiple activators.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>Current active projects concern:<\/p>\u000d\u000a<ul>\u000d\u000a<li>Analysis of the molecular mechanisms whereby activation at CRP- and FNR-dependent promoters is coupled to other activators. These promoters function as integration devices that coordinate transcriptional responses to different environmental signals.<\/li>\u000d\u000a<li>How the activity of the major <em>E. coli<\/em> housekeeping sigma factor is regulated.<\/li>\u000d\u000a<li>The application of chromatin immunoprecipitation methods to bacteria to monitor the distribution in vivo of RNA polymerase, transcription factors and nucleoid-shaping proteins.<\/li>\u000d\u000a<li>Promoters that regulate the expression of some of the major virulence determinants of pathogenic <em>E. coli<\/em> (in collaboration with Mark Pallen and Ian Henderson).<\/li>\u000d\u000a<li>The relation between the activity of bacterial promoters and their location in bacterial folded chromosomes.<\/li>\u000d\u000a<\/ul>\u000d\u000a<p><strong>Collaborators<\/strong><\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>We collaborate with different groups on the UB campus, notably with Jeff Cole (on regulation of gene expression by oxygen and nitrate\/nitrite), Dave Grainger (on bcacterial chromosome folding), Josh Rapopport (on imaging), Mark Pallen (on LEE region regulation), Ian Henderson (on the enteroaggregative <em>E. coli<\/em> toxin) and Laura Piddock (on multidrug resistance in <em>Salmonella<\/em>).

It has been based on the close reading of texts but has attempted to uncover in them the tensions and pressures of a broader shifting social and cultural world. My special interests include text-editing, and I have produced (with Elystan Griffiths) the first edition of the reform project of J. M. R. Lenz, and my interest in music has led (in collaboration with Robert Meikle) to the first edition of an opera by Reichart based a text by Goethe.

She is involved in the international interdisciplinary research network on children born of war and had published several papers on issues such as the human rights of children born of war, specific case studies and historical comparisons of such children throughout the 20th century.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>The second are of research concerns the history of 20th century science, and in particular physics. Sabine has recently co-edited a volume on the Nucleon-Nucleon Interaction and the Nuclear Many-body Problem and she is currently working on a Festschrift for the American theoretical physicist Gerald E. Brown. Prior to this, Sabine edited&nbsp; a selection of the private and scientific correspondence of the physicist Rudolf Peierls. She has also published an edition of the complete correspondence of Nobel Laureate Hans Bethe and Rudolf Peierls.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<h3>Past research<\/h3>\u000d\u000a<p>After earlier research on refugees and expellees and their organisations in post-war Germany, Sabine turned to 20th century international relations.

More recently she has studied some questions of 20th century scientific developments and the interplay between science and politics.<\/p>",

    "Biography": "<p>In 1975 he was appointed Assistant Archivist at the Borthwick Institute of Historical Research in York, moving to Birmingham as Lecturer in Medieval History in 1979. In 2001 he became Professor of Medieval Ecclesiastical History, and in 2005 Professor of Medieval History. In 2003 he was awarded the title of Guest Professor at Renmin University of China (Beijing), and at Tianjin Normal University, and in 2010 was made Guest Professor at Wuhan University. He has also lectured elsewhere in China. He held a British Academy\/Leverhulme Trust Senior Research Fellowship in 2005-6, part of which overlapped with a Membership at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton. In Spring 2010 he was a Fellow at the National Humanities Center in North Carolina.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>His initial research interests on papal and university history were broadened and transformed by contact with the ecclesiastical archives at York, which stimulated his investigations of the role of the church in late medieval English society (c.1350 to the Reformation). This developed further at Birmingham, to become a major area of teaching; it remains a significant element in his work, leading (for instance) to his work on parishes and parochial incomes, and his investigation of the role of indulgences in late medieval English religion. The social aspect of church history is complemented by an interest in the history of medieval spirituality, which expands beyond England to the rest of western Europe. This interest is primarily reflected in his book on <em>Religion and Devotion in Europe, c.1215-c.1515 (1995).<\/em> (1995).<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>Robert Swanson has been an active member of the Ecclesiastical History Society for several years, as committee member and office holder. He was President of the Society for 2007-8. Since 2007 he has been President of the British sub-commission of the Commission internationale d&rsquo;histoire et d&rsquo;etudes du christianisme (the international umbrella body for ecclesiastical history). From 1994 to 2001 he was editor of <em>Studies in Church History, overseeing the publication of eight volumes of the series<\/em>, overseeing the publication of eight volumes of the series.<\/p>",

Work on the English church has provided the basis for other books and articles, on aspects ranging from clerical careers to receipts at shrines, from the incomes of bishops to the value of benefices.

    "Research": "<p>Particular areas of interest include the history of the Blackfriars and Globe theatres; Renaissance anatomy and dissection; witchcraft, ritual and superstition in early modern England; Renaissance satiric utterance; early modern natural-historical enquiry; cultures of melancholy; the literature and material culture of wonder and curiosity; early modern figurations of monstrosity; funerary monuments and the Renaissance death-ritual; connections between Renaissance portraiture and literature; the uses of emblems in dramatic literature; the art of translation; early modern robotics and artificial life; the literary and political uses of Tacitism; the Essex circle; Puritanism; women&rsquo;s history and indomitable female figures of the Renaissance.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>I particularly enjoy interdisciplinary approaches to the study of Shakespeare and Renaissance literature, combining techniques used in art-historical, archaeological, biographical, and medical forms of historical enquiry. My interest in England&rsquo;s heritage and my methodological approach has involved me in direct on-site research at archaeological sites, castles, stately homes, museums, churches and cathedrals, grottoes and follies, auction-houses, private collections, galleries, English cultural heritage sites and other historic buildings.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>I firmly believe that sound research grounded in palaeographical experience and training in the archives is a crucial means of learning about Shakespeare and his contemporaries. The cornerstone of all my publications\/projects has always been contact with original manuscript and source material, and I have extensive experience of working with state papers, letters, diaries, wills, property deeds, heraldic documents, funerary itineraries, receipt books, medical treatises, epitaphic inscriptions, anatomical fugitive sheets, legal texts, privy council acts, and trial documents.<\/p>",
    "SchoolOrDepartment": "Shakespeare Institute",
    "Teaching": "<p>As well as lecturing on the undergraduate Shakespeare course at the University of Birmingham, I have taught extensively on University College London&rsquo;s MA in English: Shakespeare in History course, covering subjects as diverse as the politics of religious contention in the <em>Henry IV<\/em>plays; race and colonialism in <em>Othello<\/em>; witchcraft and superstition in <em>Macbeth<\/em>; the problem plays; using art-historical resources; and critical and theoretical approaches to Shakespeare. I was a long-standing lecturer and seminar leader on UCL&rsquo;s undergraduate Shakespeare course, teaching a range of works and subjects, as well as a module of my own design called &lsquo;Shakespeare&rsquo;s Bodies on the Edge&rsquo;, which looked at Shakespeare&rsquo;s treatment of such themes as sexuality, cross-dressing and charivari; torture, anatomy and dissection; death and memory; and mapping the colonial body. In addition, I provided a survey of all major critical approaches to Shakespeare, including neoclassicism, character criticism, new criticism, psychoanalysis, structuralism and post-structuralism, new historicism, feminism and race studies. During my year at Goldsmith&rsquo;s College (University of London) I commandeered an ambitious undergraduate Shakespeare course which covered almost the entire canon of his works.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>For the undergraduate Renaissance course at University College London, some of the works I taught included revenge tragedies (Thomas Kyd and Thomas Middleton); city comedies (Ben Jonson, Thomas Dekker and Thomas Middleton); Elizabethan prose fiction (John Lyly and Thomas Nashe); metaphysical poetry (John Donne); Marlowe&rsquo;s plays; Milton&rsquo;s poetry and political writings; and a full module on Ben Jonson, covering a selection of plays, court masques, the poetry, and the <em>Discoveries<\/em>.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>I have taught widely across the full spectrum of English literary history, from Chaucer to the present day, on the first-year undergraduate English course at UCL, offering classes on the &lsquo;Intellectual and Cultural Sources&rsquo;, &lsquo;Narrative Texts&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Criticism&rsquo; modules. I also have extensive experience of one-to-one tutorial teaching, offering detailed feedback on students&rsquo; essays and dissertations at undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate levels.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>I particularly enjoy teaching in interactive learning environments, having previously collaborated with the UCL Art Museum in a series of seminars called &lsquo;Shakespeare in Art&rsquo;, curating my own mini-exhibition of Shakespeare-inspired prints and etchings. I also converted the museum into an &lsquo;anatomy theatre&rsquo;, showcasing large dissection plates and anatomical sculptures, for a graduate session on &lsquo;Anatomy in Shakespeare&rsquo;. In addition to this, I organised a tour of the Warburg Institute&rsquo;s collections for MA Shakespeare students, and taught a session on &lsquo;Cultures of Collecting&rsquo; in the inspirational setting of the Grant Museum of Zoology, London, surrounded by natural-historical specimens and fossils.<\/p>",

This disciplinary shift is the logical extension of his in-country experience and close engagement with Russia&rsquo;s &lsquo;everyday&rsquo; culture.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>He has recently received research funding to investigate the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.crees.bham.ac.uk\/research\/projects\/negotiating-worker-identity-under-post-socialism.shtml\">negotiation of worker identity under post-socialism<\/a> (British Academy), and a Marie Curie grant looking at alternative approaches to development in the post-socialist region.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>His current research addresses two key debates in social research and area studies. It evaluates the transformative power of neoliberalism on the public and private identities of people in Russia and helps theorise this experience within the context of post-socialism and globalisation.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>Jeremy acted as Director of Undergraduate Programmes in Russian within CREES for five years from 2005-2010, completely overhauling undergraduate language provision, with support from a dedicated team of language-teaching professionals, making Birmingham one of the best places in the UK for students to attain all-round fluency in Russian. The programme tutors pride themselves in providing a highly demanding and satisfying student-centred learning experience, and are nationally acknowledged as providing the benchmark in virtual learning environment support. The team have received significant funding from CEELBAS (Centre for East European Language-Based Area Studies) to undertake post-graduate curriculum development and training courses that are VLE-based and can be adapted to different HE institutions&rsquo; requirements. In July 2014 he was appointed as co-director of the Centre for Russian, European and Eurasian Studies.<\/p>",

    "Biography": "<p>After a professional career in the administration of large corporations, I studied for an MPhil and then a PhD in Cultural Heritage in the Department of Archaeology in the University of Cambridge. My PhD - completed in 1993 - examined English law in terms of what law does to archaeological material and how this effects our understanding of that material, and was published as <em>Valuing Ancient Things <\/em>in 1996. From 1993 to 1999 I was a Research Fellow at Clare Hall, Cambridge, and from 1998 to 2005 an Affiliated Lecturer in the Department of Archaeology at Cambridge, involved in research and teaching. During this period, to get away from long periods spent in dusty law libraries and to get out into the open air, I began witrh Patricia Carman the <em>Bloody Meadows <\/em>Project on historic battlefields&nbsp;as landscapes, a project that continues. While at Cambridge I published&nbsp;my first contributions to Conflict Archaeology <em>Material Harm<\/em> (1997) and&nbsp;<em>Ancient Warfare<\/em> (with&nbsp;A. Harding, 1999) as well as more in the field of Heritage especially <em>Archaeology and Heritage<\/em> (2002) and <em>Against Cultural Property<\/em> (2005).<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>In 2005 I joined the Institute of Archaeology and Antiquity at the University of Birmingham as Senior Lecturer in Heritage Valuation, and in 2013 transferred to the Ironbridge International Institute for Cultural Heritage. Birmingham saw the publication of the first major output of the battlefields project in <em>Bloody Meadows <\/em>(2006) and&nbsp;a wider consideration of Conflict Archaeology in&nbsp;<em>Archaeologies of Conflict <\/em>(2013), together with involvement in the commemoration of the 1708 Battle of Oudenaarde beginning a long-standing collaboration with the Ename Center in Belgium that has also seen the foundation of the international co-operative network of battlerfield archaeologists in Europe <em>ESTOC<\/em>. I have continued to publish in Archaeology and Heritage, including <em>Heritage Studies<\/em> (with M.L.S. S&oslash;rensen, 2009<em>), Archaseological Practice in Great <\/em>Britain (with J. Schofield and P. Belford, 2011) and <em>The Oxford Handbook of Public Archaeology <\/em>(with R. Skeates and C. McDavid, 2012). My next book will be <em>Archaeological Resource Management: an international perspective<\/em> for Cambridge University Press to be followed by a second co-authored volume out of the <em>Bloody Meadows<\/em> Project.&nbsp;<\/p>",

    "Research": "<p>My overall interest is in the role in the present of material remains from the past. This involves a concern with the ideological aspects of what we call &lsquo;heritage&rsquo; and the institutions &ndash; organisational, legal, structural &ndash; that we set up to manage it. I am interested in what kinds of object we allocate to the category &lsquo;heritage&rsquo; and how we do it, and how aspects of heritage management relate to the theory and practice of archaeology as a research discipline into the past. I have a particular interest in how issues of ownership impinge upon and condition our attitudes towards and expectations of the material heritage. All of this derives from an interest in understanding the various types of value we give to our material heritage &ndash; what those values are, and from where they derive. The category of heritage is a universal one &ndash; everybody can claim to have a heritage &ndash; but the specifics of what constitutes that heritage and how it is treated vary from place to place: so I am also interested in comparing heritage practices internationally.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>A particularly interesting category of heritage is that of &lsquo;landscape&rsquo; and especially those landscapes which carry special meanings for us in the present. One such landscape type which has become the concern of archaeologists and heritage professionals is the &lsquo;historic battlefield&rsquo;. These are the subject of research by the Bloody Meadows Project &ndash; a joint enterprise with Patricia Carman &ndash; which studies such places as landscapes. Our aim is to understand the attitudes to place brought by warriors in the past to the places where they carried out their violent activities, and to compare those places so sought in one period with those sought in other periods; this leads us to apply a broadly &lsquo;phenomenological&rsquo; approach to their investigation. A related concern &ndash; and one linked with the interest in heritage value &ndash; is with the way such places are remembered or memorialised. This work was the subject of a book published by Suttons in 2006,<em> Bloody Meadows: investigating cultural landscapes of battle<\/em>.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<h3>John discusses his research into cultural heritage and battlefield archaeology<\/h3>\u000d\u000a<p><iframe src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/kM9zIhTCe6I?rel=0\" height=\"320\" width=\"510\">&nbsp;<\/iframe><\/p>",

Enthusiastic and encouraging tutors encouraged me to stay for a PhD which I completed in 1996. While studying for the PhD I worked full-time at Westhill Teacher Training College, delivering modules on Greek and Hebrew, Biblical studies, and Women and Christianity.&nbsp; In 2002 I moved to the University of Birmingham where I am now Senior Lecturer in Biblical Hermeneutics.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>&nbsp;<\/p>",

    "Research": "<p><strong>Leverhulme Major Research Fellowship (Oct 2014 to Sept 2016)&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>This fellowship supports the completion of a monograph <em>Perfect Me!.<\/em> &lsquo;Perfect me!&rsquo; can be read in a number of ways: as an individual&rsquo;s aspiration to perfect themselves (&lsquo;I want to be perfect&rsquo;), as assertion of what being perfect is (&lsquo;this is what I would be if I were perfect&rsquo;), and as a command which a woman feels she should obey (&lsquo;you should be perfect&rsquo;).<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>Perfect Me! explores all of these meanings, with particular focus on the moral element that each reading implies: the first, that being perfect is worth having; the second, a judgement that this is what perfection is; and the third, a moral imperative to attain it.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>In addition to analysing the ideal of perfection as it is manifested in the dominant beauty ideal as a moral ideal, Professor Widdows will critique the current reliance on individual choice and consent in determining the ethics of beauty practices. She will also focus on the picture of the moral self which underlies this ideal and suggest that there is a shift from identification of the self with the physical\/observed body to the imagined body.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p><strong>The Changing Requirements of Beauty <br \/><\/strong>AHRC Network (January 2015 &ndash; June 2016)<br \/>PI Heather Widdows, Co-I Jean McHale<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>This project considers changing attitudes to body image and the consequent changing uses of procedures which have traditionally been regarded as 'medical'; for instance, according to BAAPS, 43,172 surgical procedures were carried out in 2012, and the most popular are concerned overtly with appearance and beauty (the most popular procedures in the UK are breast augmentation, eyelid surgery and face\/neck lifts). Moreover, surveys suggest that if money was not an issue far more women would undergo such procedures, which are seen as increasingly 'normal', 'routine' and part of the 'beauty regimes' of 'ordinary women'.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>This project considers the beauty norms which underlie this trend from cross-disciplinary and cross-sectoral perspectives. The assumption of the network is that beauty image is becoming ever more demanding and defining of women, and increasingly men, irrespective of their professions. The project will ask whether this is the case, and how this norm is constituted and how it impacts upon women. It will also ask whether the dominant beauty norm is increasingly a global beauty norm, and thus open to less cultural and sub-cultural resistance. The project is especially concerned with role of technology in this. In particular, that procedures which were once regarded as 'exceptional' such as the use of surgery, are now regarded as 'normal' or even 'required' in certain contexts. Other increasingly demanding beauty requirements include hair removal and 'non-invasive' procedures to reduce the appearance of wrinkles. All of these procedures, whether 'routine' or 'exceptional', require time and effort to maintain, and arguably the 'minimum' required is increasing; fewer women go 'bare faced' or bare their flesh without hair removal.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>This project will explore the extent to which beauty norms are changing and how as well as what this means for individuals, for regulation and for clinical practice. It explores the 'perfectionist trend' that extends the use of medical and scientific procedures to 'cosmetic procedures'. In light of this it will explore how the use and development of such procedures in the service of such norms changes the concepts of 'health', 'normality' and 'perfection' and in turn how these feed into self-understandings and identity, social expectations, medical practice and regulation.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<ul>\u000d\u000a<li>Visit <a title=\"BeautyDemands\" href=\"\/generic\/beauty\/index.aspx\" class=\"sys_0 sys_t103087\">Visit BeautyDemands website<\/a><\/li>\u000d\u000a<\/ul>\u000d\u000a<p><strong>ESRC Nuclear Ethics and Global Security: Reforming the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Regime (Oct 2014-2016)&nbsp; <br \/><\/strong>PI is Professor&nbsp; Nicholas J Wheeler, Co-I Dr Dr Anthony Burke and&nbsp;Professor Heather Widdows<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>At a moment of profound crisis, uncertainty, and yet potential opportunity in the <strong>nuclear non-proliferation regime<\/strong>, this project will investigate possible paths for the reform and strengthening of the regime through an engagement with ethical and normative thinking in the fields of <strong>Philosophy <\/strong>and <strong>International Relations. <\/strong>The project straddles the related sub-fields of global ethics, political theory, normative international relations theory, and security studies.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>The project questions how far the bargain at the heart of the 1968 Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) is ethically defensible and whether the relationship between hierarchy and sovereignty within the treaty can endure.

Running through all research areas are the techniques of flow cytometry and molecular biology.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<h4>Engineering biofilms for bioprocesses<\/h4>\u000d\u000a<p>In collaboration with <a title=\"Professor Mark Simmons\" href=\"\/staff\/profiles\/chemical-engineering\/simmons-mark.aspx\" class=\"sys_0 sys_t1491564\">Mark Simmons<\/a> (UoB) and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.uea.ac.uk\/che\/people\/faculty\/gossr\">Rebecca Goss<\/a> (St. Andrews), this major BBSRC-funded project aims to generate and utilise engineered biofilms for biotransformation reactions to produce small molecules used in pharmaceutical production. Although more usually a problem for the process industries, biofilms offer many advantages over planktonic cells for biotransformation and biocatalysis reactions. This project is developing tools, from the molecular to the process scale, in order to use biofilms as immobilised catalysts for fine chemical biotransformations.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<h4>Recombinant protein production<\/h4>\u000d\u000a<p>A TSB and BBSRC-funded <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ktponline.org.uk\/\">Knowledge Transfer Partnership<\/a> in collaboration with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cobrabio.com\/\">Cobra Biologics<\/a> is currently investigating production of recombinant proteins in bacterial hosts. This project expands upon previous BBSRC-funded research and PhD projects. A major aim of this work is to develop methods by which recombinant protein production bioprocesses can become more predictable and failure rates can be decreased. Further details on the project are available in a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.birmingham.ac.uk\/partners\/business-services\/news\/items\/University-of-Birmingham-toteam-up-with-Cobra-Biologics-under-a-KTP.aspx\">press release<\/a>.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>An ERA-IB grant focuses on the development of novel methods to isolate high-value products from horse serum.

    "Biography": "Dr Cynthia Carliell-Marquet trained as a microbiologist and biochemist at the University of Natal (South Africa), then went on to do a postgraduate Research MSc in Chemical Engineering (University of Natal) where she applied her microbiological background to industrial wastewater treatment by developing an anaerobic biological system for removing colour from textile dye wastewaters. This was followed by a move to the UK and a PhD in Civil Engineering (Loughborough University, UK), this time focussing on metal and phosphorus chemistry in anaerobic digesters. Cynthia joined Civil Engineering at Birmingham as a lecturer in Water and Environmental Engineering, in 1999. <br \/><br \/>\u000d\u000a<p>Dr Carliell-Marquet&rsquo;s research activity is best described as resource recovery from wastewater and, in particular, from the anaerobic digestion process. Within this, primary interests are biological methane production from biomass wastes and the biochemical and physical factors that increase or hamper methane production rates, together with recovery of mineral resources (phosphorus, nitrogen) from digested biomass wastes.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<br \/>\u000d\u000a<p>She has recently won three EPSRC CASE award grants related to biomass AD and phosphorus recovery from wastewater, the first of which (trace element supplementation to boost biogas from digesters) has led to a successful Knowledge Transfer Partnership award that will see the outcomes applied to the Water industry during 2011-2012. The most recent CASE award (Closing the loop for phosphorus) attracted considerable interest from the UK Water Industry, with 14 parties (including all the major UK water companies) signing up to support the research. This research is leading the area in the UK and has resulted in her being invited to join, in 2011, an ambitious world-wide research project on global phosphorus security (Global TraPs) led by ETH, Zurich. Dr Carliell-Marquet&rsquo;s research group have also been very involved in the setting up and running of the Global Phosphorus Network (http:\/\/globalpnetwork.net), which was newly launched at the Sustainable Phosphorus Summit in Arizona in January 2011. The Global Phosphorus Network provides a virtual meeting place for the emerging international research community working on phosphorus and food security.<\/p>",

    "Research": "<p><b>RESEARCH THEMES <br \/><\/b><br \/>Dr Carliell-Marquet&rsquo;s research falls within the broad theme of resource recovery from waste and covers two distinct areas: <br \/><br \/>The first area, and where she has spent most of her research career, is the anaerobic digestion process. Dr Carliell-Marquet is particularly interested in developing our knowledge of biochemical reactions at the cellular level and relating this knowledge to operational and engineering aspects of these systems to maximise methane recovery and improve system resilience and robustness. A significant part of her current research is aimed at understanding the complex metal-microbe reactions that occur in anaerobic digesters, which involves laboratory experimentation and equilibrium speciation modelling to understand the factors that render metals bioavailable or unavailable within digesters. The goal of this research is to predict how a digester will react to changes in the metal balance within the digestion environment and to use these predictions to enhance process performance and methane recovery. As part of this on-going research, her research group is also trying to understand the relationship between acetate-to-methane conversion rates, methanogenic populations and the inorganic environment in sludge digesters. A third aspect of the anaerobic digestion research is investigating the implications of digester mixing on biological methane production, relating the physical aspects of digester mixing to methanogenic diversity and biochemical reactions rates. <br \/><br \/>The second area of research is recovery of phosphorus from wastewater and organic wastes. Current projects include an assessment of global phosphorus reserves to determine when and how phosphorus recovery could become an economically viable proposition for the UK Water Industry. Combining both the anaerobic digestion and phosphorus recovery elements is a second project which aims to determine how phosphorus recovery can be sustainably combined with energy recovery for various scales of anaerobic digestion facilities, both in the UK and India. <br \/><br \/><b>RESEARCH ACTIVITY <br \/><\/b><br \/>2011-2014 Global transdisciplinary processes preparing for sustainably coping with phosphorous from a supply chain perspective (Global TraPs).

    "Biography": "<p>Robert (Bob) Stone is a Chartered Ergonomist &amp; Human Factors Specialist and holds a Chair in Interactive Multimedia Systems within the&nbsp;<a title=\"College of Engineering and Physical Sciences\" href=\"\/university\/colleges\/eps\/index.aspx\" class=\"sys_0 sys_t1491561\">College of Engineering and Physical Sciences<\/a>at the University of Birmingham, where he is also Director of the Human Interface Technologies (HIT) Team.&nbsp; He graduated from University College London in 1979 with a BSc in Psychology, and in 1981 with an MSc in Ergonomics.&nbsp; Stone also currently holds the position of Visiting Professor in Simulation Psychology within the University of Plymouth, his home town, and was made an Honorary Professor of the South Russia State Technical University (Novocherkassk) at that University&rsquo;s 100<sup>th<\/sup> Anniversary in 2007.&nbsp; After nine years of Human Factors research at British Aerospace in Bristol, where he specialised in military ergonomics and remotely operated systems (conducting applied research for the Department of Energy and the European Space Agency), Stone was involved in the launch of the UK&rsquo;s National Advanced Robotics Research Centre, funded by the Department of Trade &amp; Industry.&nbsp; Stone was the first European to experience the NASA <em>VIEW<\/em> Virtual Reality (VR) system and, in 1987, he established the UK&rsquo;s first industrial VR team at the Robotics Centre where, amongst numerous achievements, he developed the world&rsquo;s first tactile feedback glove for VR applications, <em>Teletact<\/em>.&nbsp; Following an appearance on the BBC&rsquo;s <em>9 O&rsquo;Clock News<\/em> in January, 1993, he brought together (initially) 12 companies to fund the world&rsquo;s first industrial collaborative project addressing the commercial uses of VR.&nbsp; The success of this initiative enabled Stone&rsquo;s group to be launched as VR Solutions Ltd in the mid-1990s, a company in which he remained a Director until 2002.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>In May 1996, Stone was elected to become an Academician of the Russian International Higher Education Academy of Sciences and was, in 2000, accredited by General Klimuk, Director of Russia&rsquo;s Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centre as responsible for &ldquo;introducing VR into the cosmonaut space programme&rdquo;.&nbsp; Stone was the Research Director of the UK Human Factors Integration Defence Technology Centre for over 6 years, and it is from within this Centre that many of his team&rsquo;s projects originate, covering human-centred design and evaluation methodologies for applications as varied as close-range weapons training and support for surgical and mental health therapies to submarine safety awareness, IED search and disposal training and unmanned vehicle control.&nbsp; Stone and his team adopt a very pragmatic approach to Human Factors research and he regularly spends time conducting observational studies in the field with subject matter experts.&nbsp; This has taken him from Royal Navy vessels conducting close-range weapons and missile trials to underwater operations onboard submarines and rescue submersibles; from oil and gas support platforms in the North Sea to remotely operated vehicle trials in the waters around Scotland; and from search-and-rescue helicopters over the mountains and coasts of Wales and Cornwall to operating theatres and medical units throughout the UK, US and South Africa.&nbsp; From an impact perspective, Stone&rsquo;s defence research has influenced the uptake of VR technologies &ndash; in particular submarine safety training &ndash; throughout the Armed Forces in the UK, Canada and Australia, and his team&rsquo;s high-fidelity <em>CUTLASS<\/em> bomb disposal simulator, the result of 3 years of Dstl research funding, is now installed in bases across the UK (Including Northern Ireland), Cyprus and Gibraltar.&nbsp; More recently, Stone and his team have been undertaking innovative research for Dstl and BAE Systems addressing future reconfigurable multimodal and mixed reality centres for naval and land-based command and control applications.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>Also from an impact perspective, Stone&rsquo;s pioneering surgical task analysis efforts in the mid-1990s led to the development of a suite of simulated perceptual-motor tasks for a unique keyhole surgery VR trainer (<em>MIST<\/em>), marketed for nearly a decade by Mentice of Sweden.&nbsp; From 1999 to 2002, Stone sat on a working party on behalf of the Royal College of Surgeons&rsquo; Joint Committee on Higher Surgical Training investigating the assessment of surgical training and competence and, in January 2000, passed the Royal College of Surgeons of England&rsquo;s Basic Surgical Skills course.&nbsp; Stone was a Simulation Human Factors consultant to the US Office of Naval Research-funded <em>Pulse!!<\/em> Virtual Healthcare Project (led by Texas A&amp;M University Corpus Christi).&nbsp; Today, he works closely with the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine, military and civilian medical personnel within the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham and the European Centre for Environment and Human Health.&nbsp; He is also an Honorary Consultant in Human Factors &amp; Simulation within the UK&rsquo;s Hollier Medical Simulation Centre.&nbsp; Stone&rsquo;s team also pioneered early developments in Virtual Heritage, notably <em>Virtual Stonehenge<\/em> (1996), complete with the world&rsquo;s first virtual sunrise and accurate night-time sky (a revised version using gaming technologies was delivered to English Heritage in 2009) and <em>Virtual Lowry<\/em>, a project in which the artist&rsquo;s <em>Coming From The Mill<\/em> painting was brought to life using VR techniques.&nbsp; This and other cultural heritage projects supported Stone and colleagues from the US and Japan to launch the international Virtual Systems &amp; Multi-Media organisation and virtualheritage.net in 1997.&nbsp; He is also a trustee of the US Institute for the Visualization of History.&nbsp; Today, Stone continues research in the field of cultural heritage and is particularly interested in digital inclusion and public engagement, maritime heritage (including projects based on the 1914 loss of the submarine HMS <em>A7<\/em>, HMS <em>Caroline<\/em> and the <em>Anne<\/em>, a 17<sup>th<\/sup> Century ship of the line) and the exploitation of remotely controlled ground, air and underwater systems in support of heritage site surveys.&nbsp; His team has an exclusive relationship with the National Museum of the Royal Navy.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>His work has received numerous awards, including, in 2003, the Laval Virtual Troph&eacute;e d&rsquo;Honneur for his &ldquo;service to the European Virtual Reality Community&rdquo; since 1987.&nbsp; In 2007, he was awarded the UK Institute of Ergonomics &amp; Human Factors&rsquo; (previously the Ergonomics Society) Sir Frederic Bartlett Award, the highest award given by that Society to an individual (and the first time ever that an individual had been awarded by the Society three times in their career).&nbsp; In 2011, he received the MoD Chief Scientific Advisor&rsquo;s Commendation for his contribution to Defence Science &amp; Technology &ndash; one of only four individual recipients in the UK.&nbsp; Later that year, his Defence Technology Centre Serious Games Team received the BAE Systems Chairman&rsquo;s Silver Award for simulation research contributing to front line safety.<\/p>",

However, developing hydrogen as a major energy carrier, will require solutions to many scientific and technological challenges.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p><strong>Solid-state Hydrogen Storage<\/strong><\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>One challenge is to how to effectively store hydrogen on vehicles. Conventional storage solutions include liquefaction or compression, however there are energy efficiency and major safety concerns associated with both these options.&nbsp;Therefore, there is a great need to develop viable solid-state storage materials.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<ul>\u000d\u000a<li>\u000d\u000a<div>Magnesium: With a theoretical reversible hydrogen uptake value of 7.6 weight%, Mg is a candidate for a new storage medium. However, the hydrogen sorption temperature needs to be reduced (from around 300 &deg;C to 100-150 &deg;C), and the kinetics need to be accelerated. &nbsp;It has been shown that the sorption kinetics can be greatly improved by: introducing a nanoscale microstructure to provide a pathway for hydrogen diffusion; and by catalyzing the surface. The thermodynamics now need to be improved by alloying Mg to form a new compound or phase.&nbsp;Our work is investigating nanostructured Mg alloys produced by ball-milling, thin-film multilayers, and by rapid solidification.<\/div>\u000d\u000a<\/li>\u000d\u000a<li>\u000d\u000a<div>Complex Hydrides: Borohydride compounds are promising hydrogen storage materials (e.g. lithium borohydride is able to store up to 18 wt%), but which require elevated temperatures (200 &ndash; 300 &deg;C) for hydrogen desorption and suffer poor reversibility (i.e. re-absorption of hydrogen is difficult). We are investigating Transition-metal-based borohydrides, produced by ball-milling and by high-pressure synthesis. We have found that the hydrogen desorption temperature in such compounds can be greatly reduced. We are now using in situ XRD and Raman spectroscopy (with 100 bar hydrogen cells) to study the phases that form during hydrogen desorption and reabsorption, with the aim of producing more reversible materials.<\/div>\u000d\u000a<\/li>\u000d\u000a<li>\u000d\u000a<div>Nanocarbons: nanostructured graphite-based materials may store up to 7 wt% hydrogen, which offers the prospect of an inexpensive, widely available storage medium. However, this material needs to be heated to 800 &deg;C to remove all the hydrogen, and reversibility is poor (limited to a few cycles after mixing with LiH).&nbsp;In order to improve the reabsorption process, we are studying how the hydrogen is stored, the role of carbon &lsquo;dangling bonds&rsquo;, and the effect of microstructure.<\/div>\u000d\u000a<\/li>\u000d\u000a<\/ul>\u000d\u000a<p><strong>Hydrogen Separation Membranes<\/strong><\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>Any important challenge is how to provide extremely pure hydrogen, for use with PEM Fuel Cells?<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>Hydrogen produced from natural gas reformers and from biomass sources, usually contains small amount of impurity gases, such as carbon monoxide, methane, and sulphur.&nbsp;A PEM Fuel Cell converts hydrogen and oxygen gases into electricity; however, even very small amounts of impurities in the hydrogen can reduce the operating life of the Fuel Cell.&nbsp;In addition, there are applications in semiconductor and LED manufacture that require ultra-pure hydrogen.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>Metallic diffusion membranes can be used to purify hydrogen: certain Pd-based alloys will allow only hydrogen gas to pass through (the impurity gas molecules are too large), resulting in parts-per-billion level pure hydrogen. However, the conventional membrane alloy used (Pd-Ag) is rather expensive, and cannot be used in the presence of impurities such as CO and S.&nbsp;We are investigating materials with less or no Pd with comparable membranes properties. We have also been studying the fabrication of thin-film and rapidly solidified membranes.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p><strong>Permanent Magnets<\/strong><\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>Permanent magnets are now essential components in many fields of technology, and have found applications in a wide range of devices.&nbsp;In 1984, the Nd<sub>2<\/sub>Fe<sub>14<\/sub>B magnet phase was developed by: powder metallurgy to form anisotropic, fully dense sintered magnets; and melt-spinning to produce isotropic magnetic powders, which can then be compacted to form bonded magnets. Although bonded magnets have poorer magnetic properties, the ability to form complex geometries has lead to bonded magnets becoming the fastest growing sector of the permanent magnet market.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>Therefore, there was great interest in 1989, when a new technique &ndash; which came to be called Hydrogen Disproportionation Desorption Recombination (HDDR) &ndash; was developed, that subsequently allowed the production of anisotropic magnetic powders (anisotropic magnet powders have better magnetic properties than isotropic).&nbsp;The HDDR process involves exposing ingots of Nd-Fe-B to a series of carefully controlled heat treatments under hydrogen and vacuum. However, the mechanism behind the formation of anisotropic material&nbsp; still requires further study.<\/p>",

    "Biography": "<p>Alessandro Mottura received his MEng degree (first class) in Materials Science and Engineering in 2006, from Imperial College London. He went on to study for a PhD in Metallurgy under the supervision of Professor Mike W Finnis and Professor Roger C Reed, also at Imperial College London. During his PhD, Alessandro Mottura focussed on explaining how rhenium additions affect the creep properties of single-crystal Ni-based superalloys. This work was part of a wider effort to establish a more rigorous path to the design of new alloys, carried out in collaboration with the University of Oxford, the University of Cambridge and the University of Birmingham. Alessandro&rsquo;s research involved the use of density functional theory (DFT) simulations, atom probe tomography (APT) and extended x-ray absorption fine spectroscopy (EXAFS) to establish and clarify the role of rhenium in these alloys.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>After obtaining his PhD, Alessandro joined the group of Professor Tresa M Pollock, at the University of California, Santa Barbara. At UCSB, Alessandro kept working on using DFT simulations to guide the design of new &gamma;&rsquo;-strengthened Co-based superalloys. Beside his involvement on the design of new Co-based superalloys, Alessandro also worked on building a new 3-dimensional characterisation tool that utilises a femtosecond laser to ablate material layer by layer, and an electron microscope to image the newly revealed surface at each step. Albeit working in a similar way to FIB-tomography (or serial-sectioning) this technique allows the generation of much larger multi-modal datasets that include both chemical and crystallographic information.<\/p>",

    "Biography": "<p>Kostas Nikolopoulos obtained his Ph.D. on the ATLAS experiment with the University of Athens (Greece) in 2010. His thesis was awarded Marc Virchaux Prize. Subsequently, he joined the Brookhaven National Laboratory (USA) as a post-doctoral research associate, and since 2012 he joined the University of Birmingham as a Lecturer and Birmingham Fellow. In October 2014, he was elected ATLAS UK Physics coordinator.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>Became heavily involved in the H&rarr;ZZ*&rarr;4l analysis already before data-taking, developing the tools and strategies that were used in the actual data analysis. In Oct 2010 he was appointed convener of the ATLAS H &rarr; ZZ group (Higgs boson decays channels involving Z bosons), consisting of more than 100 physicists. His term of office was exceptionally extended (Oct 2011) for an additional year and he led the group in the discovery of Higgs boson-like particle in July 2012. Subsequently, he turned his attention to the study of the properties of the Higgs boson with emphasis on the mass, production rates, and couplings. He introduced analysis categories with topologies sensitive to the Higgs boson production mechanism, and experimental variables that enhanced the sensitivity to coupling properties through multi-observable maximum-likelihood fits. This culminated in several publications establishing the Standard Model-like character of the observed Higgs boson.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>Furthermore, he is interested in searches for physics Beyond the Standard Model in the Higgs sector; both through the search for additional Higgs boson and through anomalous decays of the observed Higgs boson. He has led the team that performed the first search for the decay of the Higgs boson to a quarkonium state and a photon (H &rarr; J\/&psi;&gamma; and H &rarr; &Upsilon;&gamma;), as well as the previously unobserved analogous decays of the Z boson. This analysis provides first information on the Yukawa coupling of the charm quark.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>Kostas is a co-investigator on the Birmingham Particle Physics grant from the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC).<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>In recent years has also received funding in support of his work from the Marie Curie actions and the Durham Institute of Particle Physics Phenomenology.&nbsp;<\/p>",

It explores the shifting stances amongst Conservatives within an economic, political and international context as the party adjusted to the decline of Britain&rsquo;s world role and the loss of empire. It analyzes Britain&rsquo;s role and relationship with Europe together with the study of the Conservative Party, and deals with economic, commercial and monetary issues, successfully bridging a serious gap in any discussion of the UK&rsquo;s relations with the European Union and offers an appreciation of the political world in which Conservative European policy has been framed and pursued since 1945.

Collin Brooks recorded for posterity his observations of the journalistic, political, literary and financial sets in which he circulated. The journals open with Brooks working at the Financial News. His move to the Sunday Dispatch, his rise to the editorial chair, and his intimate friendship with Lord Rothermere ensure that these journals offer a unique insight into the operations and mentality of a press baron. Further, the diaries offer a perspective upon dissident right-wing Conservatism during the leaderships of Baldwin and Chamberlain, giving insights into the debates over India, rearmament and foreign policy as well as the continued flirtations with Mosley and fascism. They offer a fascinating snapshot of Britain in the 1930s.

This book provides a complete examination of how the Conservative party responded to the problems of European fascism from 1935 to 1940. Facing Fascism provides the historical context for the foreign policy of the period. Drawing on neglected sources it gives a new perspective on the party&rsquo;s policies, focusing on members of the government aside from just Chamberlain and highlights important aspects such as the controversy over national service. It offers alternative and original interpretations of the reactions of various elements of the Conservative party to the deepening international crisis.

During my BA, I was awarded the Oxford Heath Harrison Travel Scholarship by examination and a national Peter Kirk Travel Scholarship.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>For my M.St in Modern European Literatures, also undertaken at Trinity, Oxford and funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council, I specialized in Francophone Caribbean Literature. This was followed by my AHRC-funded D.Phil at Trinity, in which I examined how leading Francophone Caribbean authors from Martinique, Guadeloupe and Haiti have established a tradition of postcolonial childhood narratives which mobilize childhood in as much a politically as an aesthetically subversive manner.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>During my D.Phil, I was also&nbsp;a French&nbsp;Tutor&nbsp;for&nbsp;the Oxford Sutton Trust Summer School, an access&nbsp;scheme for state school pupils, which I had attended myself as a Sixth Former in 1999.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>My research to date has been supported through major funding awards including an AHRC Early Career Leadership Fellowship (2014-2016) for research on Joseph Zobel, which has a live project blog: <a href=\"http:\/\/josephzobel.wordpress.com\/\">http:\/\/josephzobel.wordpress.com\/<\/a>. I have also been Principal Investigator on an EU-funded Marie Curie Inter-European Fellowship (2012-2014) on Caribbean Biopolitics, and this research collaboration was detailed by the Postdoctoral Fellow Dr Alessandro Corio at: <a href=\"http:\/\/caribiolit.wordpress.com\/\">http:\/\/caribiolit.wordpress.com\/<\/a><\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>Along with my colleague, Dr Berny S&egrave;be, a trained historian, I created the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.birmingham.ac.uk\/postgraduate\/courses\/taught\/arts-law-inter\/colonial-postcolonial-studies.aspx\">MA in Colonial and Postcolonial Studies<\/a> which offers students a chance to examine the creation and legacy of colonialism in a comparative framework. The course is entirely delivered in English, with the option for students to work with a range of modern languages (European and beyond) where possible. Postgraduates also have access to wider research seminars such as those promoted through the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.birmingham.ac.uk\/schools\/lcahm\/departments\/french\/research\/francopoco.aspx\">FRANCOPOCO Network<\/a>.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>My research involves working collaboratively with a range of international non-academic partners:<\/p>\u000d\u000a<ul>\u000d\u000a<li>UK: British Library, London; Library of Birmingham; Midlands Arts Centre<\/li>\u000d\u000a<li>France: Passions Partag&eacute;es Zobel Network, supported by the French Ministry for Education, Ministry for Overseas Territories and Ministry for Diversity<\/li>\u000d\u000a<li>Martinique: Rivi&egrave;re-Sal&eacute;e: M&eacute;diath&egrave;que Public Library; JosephZobelHigh School; GeorgesElisabethMiddle School \/ Fort-de-France: RegionalMuseum of History and Ethnography<\/li>\u000d\u000a<\/ul>",

This 3-year interdisciplinary project provides a new perspective on prison visitation and its relationship to the highly topical issue of recidivism.

The project studies: the process of designing new prison buildings in order to understand what it is that architects are asked to deliver and how they achieve this; and ADT&rsquo;s impacts and effects on a range of end users, focusing on the experience of occupying and moving in and around prison spaces, in relation to prisoners&rsquo; quality of life and wellbeing, perceptions of penal legitimacy, compliance with the regime, prisoner-staff relations, staff work satisfaction and so on.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p><strong>Prison Visitation and Recidivism in Northern Ireland&nbsp;<\/strong>is a project funded by the ESRC Impact Acceleration Account (IAA) at the University of Birmingham.

    "Research": "<p><strong>Visual Perception <br \/><\/strong><br \/>Human vision can process information conveyed by variations in 'first-order' image properties such as luminance, and 'second-order' (or texture) properties such as orientation and local contrast. The main focus of my research is to explore the properties of second-order processing in humans and the application of these findings to machine vision. <br \/><br \/>Local orientation is one of the main cues to surface texture. It seems that some cells in the visual system are sensitive to orientation-contrast and, during my PhD (1990-1993), I discovered that these cells can explain human performance in a number of texture related tasks. <br \/><br \/>In my work with Mark Georgeson (1996-1999) I looked at local contrast as a texture cue. We found that the processing of local contrast is essentially independent of the processing of luminance signals but that the two can combine to form \/ enhance useful image precepts such as depth from shading. <br \/><br \/>My most recent work has concerned the processing of different types of texture (eg orientation and local contrast). In particular I have been asking 'are different texture cues detected independently?' Results suggest that they are but only weakly as if there is one system that is designed to allow the cues to be detected independently but which does not ensure full independence. Once one goes beyond detection to look at texture processing at higher levels it is clear that the two cues do interact. For example adaptation after-effects such as the tilt after effect transfer between orientation and contrast cues. <br \/><br \/>I am also interested in how variations in texture affect our ability to perceive transparency and shading cues. It seems that changes in texture amplitude provide a key be which changes in shading across a texture are cued. If amplitude and shading are positively correlated one sees a single shaded surface. But when amplitude and shading are negatively correlated one sees a reflectance or material change. This work has been extended to produce a machine vision algorithm for separating illuminations changes from reflectance changes in images.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p><strong>Collaborators \/ co-workers<br \/><\/strong>Mark Georgeson, Frederick Kingdom, Tim Ledgeway, Gill Barbieri-Hesse, Tim Yates, Paul Rock, Alice Cruickshank, Peng Sun, Xiaoyue Jiang.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p><strong>Links relating to my research<\/strong><\/p>\u000d\u000a<ul>\u000d\u000a<li>Vision Laboratory (<a id=\"CMS_A02cac9299aee49458259c5e28697608f\" href=\"http:\/\/www.vision.bham.ac.uk\/\">www.vision.bham.ac.uk<\/a>)<\/li>\u000d\u000a<li>Birmingham Object Lighting Database (<a id=\"CMS_A1aab2eea8bd141138bd8298e4534fba3\" href=\"http:\/\/www.bold.bham.ac.uk\/\">www.bold.bham.ac.uk<\/a>)<\/li>\u000d\u000a<\/ul>\u000d\u000a<p>&nbsp;<\/p>",

as either world leading or internationally excellent in the most recent Research Assessment Exercise by the Higher Education Funding Council for England.&nbsp;Most children with cancer in the UK are treated by clinicians who are members of the Children's Cancer and Leukaemia Group (CCLG), formerly the United Kingdom Children&rsquo;s Cancer Study Group (UKCCSG).&nbsp;As a result of the Director being a full member of this organisation, and also being a member of its Late Effects Group (with responsibilities concerning CCLG policy in relation to the care of survivors) excellent links are maintained with the clinicians treating and following-up children with cancer.&nbsp;There are also close collaborative research links with the Childhood Cancer Research Group, based at the University of Oxford, which maintains the population-based National Registry of Childhood Tumours.&nbsp;The Centre is well known internationally through its publications and attendance at most important meetings concerned with survivors of childhood cancer.&nbsp;Collaborative international studies of the adverse consequences of irradiation in childhood have been undertaken including data relating to survivors of the atomic bombs in Japan.&nbsp;There is an established international collaborative programme of studies of the incidence and aetiology of second primary neoplasms after childhood cancer in Britain and France.&nbsp;Good links exist with the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study which is ongoing in North America and co-ordinated from St Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis.&nbsp;An international collaborative study of the joint influences of radiation and genotype on breast cancer risk is nearing completion and was funded by the European Commission under the 6<sup>th<\/sup>

Evidence for the cure of specific types of cancer would also be assessed.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>Record linkages between the established database and the national death and cancer registries, the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) for England, the Patient Episode Database for Wales (PEDW) in Wales and the Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project (MINAP) will be undertaken.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>From such linkages it will be possible to identify subgroups of patients (defined in terms of type of cancer, age at treatment, calendar year of diagnosis, period of follow-up, attained age and sex) at a substantially increased risk of specific adverse health outcomes.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>The study, funded by Cancer Research UK in 2010, will be the first comprehensive investigation of fatal and non-fatal serious adverse health outcomes of cancer treatment in teenagers and young adults and the population-based design and large sample size would undoubtedly lead to a landmark contribution.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p><strong><a title=\"PanCare childhood and adolescent cancer Survivor care and Follow-up studies (PanCareSurFup)\" href=\"\/research\/activity\/mds\/projects\/HaPS\/PHEB\/CCCSS\/PanCare\/index.aspx\" class=\"sys_0 sys_t1491565\">PanCare childhood and adolescent cancer Survivor care and Follow-up studies (PanCareSurFup)<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>This five-year programme grant from the European Commission for the first pan-European collaborative study of survivors of childhood and adolescent cancer was initiated in February 2011.&nbsp;It includes investigators from Austria, the Nordic countries, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Slovenia, Hungary and Switzerland.&nbsp;The broad objectives are:<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>1.&nbsp;Establish three adverse health outcome specific and retrospectively ascertained pan-European cohorts of survivors of childhood cancer within which the occurrence of late mortality, second malignant sarcomas and carcinomas, and cardiac events have been (or may be) systematically ascertained and validated. Focusing on carcinomas which are common in the general population after age 40 years and which are frequent among survivors including commonly observed digestive and genitourinary sites.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>2.&nbsp;Undertake individual patient radiation dosimetry for individuals included within the nested case-control studies to obtain estimates of dose to the site of development of the adverse event and the corresponding site in the matched controls.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>3.&nbsp;Estimate the absolute risk of each of these adverse health outcomes within the relevant cohort and compare observed and expected numbers of events where general population rates are available to enable the calculation of expected numbers. Of particular interest will be the comparison of observed and expected numbers among those aged over 40 years.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>4.&nbsp;Execute three nested case-control studies of cardiac disease, second malignant sarcoma and second malignant carcinoma, respectively, and one cohort study of late mortality, occurring among survivors to determine the aspects of radiotherapy and type and dose of chemotherapy associated with increased risk.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>5.&nbsp;Produce clinical follow-up guidelines for health care professionals, survivors and their families based on existing evidence and the results from this study in terms of the absolute risk available from the cohort studies and the relative risks in relation to risk factors from the case-control studies, as they become available. This includes issues related to transition from a paediatric to adult environment for on-going follow-up.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>6.&nbsp;Establish partnerships between providers and survivor\/parent groups to disseminate information about PanCareSurFup to the general public, to health professionals and survivor\/parent groups; train health care professionals through conferences, workshops, booklets and web based information; empower and educate survivors to be as informed as possible concerning their long-term risks, and about general and specific health promotion measures that they can use to optimise their future well-being.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p><strong>European Cohort Study of Survivors of Childhood Cancer<\/strong><\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>This study is organised jointly by Dr Florent de Vathaire at the Institut Gustave Roussy in France and Professor Mike Hawkins at the Centre for Childhood Cancer Survivor Studies in the UK.&nbsp;The area of investigation so far has been concerned with the risks and causes of second primary neoplasms.&nbsp;The product of this collaboration may be seen among our publications below at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bccss.bham.ac.uk\" onclick=\"void(window.open('http:\/\/www.bccss.bham.ac.uk','','toolbar=yes,menubar=yes,location=yes,scrollbars=yes,status=yes,resizable=yes'));return false;\" onkeypress=\"void(window.open('http:\/\/www.bccss.bham.ac.uk','','toolbar=yes,menubar=yes,location=yes,scrollbars=yes,status=yes,resizable=yes'));return false;\">www.bccss.bham.ac.uk<\/a><\/p>\u000d\u000a<p><strong>Gen-Rad-Risk (<a href=\"http:\/\/generadrisk.iarc.fr\" onclick=\"void(window.open('http:\/\/generadrisk.iarc.fr','','toolbar=yes,menubar=yes,location=yes,scrollbars=yes,status=yes,resizable=yes'));return false;\" onkeypress=\"void(window.open('http:\/\/generadrisk.iarc.fr','','toolbar=yes,menubar=yes,location=yes,scrollbars=yes,status=yes,resizable=yes'));return false;\">http:\/\/generadrisk.iarc.fr<\/a>)<\/strong><\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>This is an international collaborative study of the effects of genotype and radiation (and their interaction) in the aetiology of breast cancer co-ordinated by the International Agency for Research on Cancer and funded by the EU.&nbsp;Professor Hawkins is the co-ordinator and grant holder for the UK contribution relating to survivors of childhood cancer.&nbsp;Dr Reulen and Professor Hawkins are leading the international collaborative analysis of the nested case-control study carried out among childhood cancer survivors from throughout Europe.<\/p>",

    "Biography": "<p>Tom Marshall graduated MB ChB from the University of Edinburgh in 1987. He undertook clinical posts in hospitals the UK, South Africa and Gibraltar where he acquired his interest in the wider determinants of health and organisation of health care systems. In 1991 he undertook a MSc Health Economics at University of York. Following this he returned to clinical medicine to complete vocational training in general practice and his MRCGP before specialising in public health medicine in Northamptonshire. During this period he completed his MSc in Public Health, obtained the MFPH and spent a total of one year (in 1996 and 1997) working for the WHO Regional Office for Europe on health care systems and health care reforms in European countries.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>In 1999 Tom moved to an academic post in public health in University of Birmingham and completed his PhD: an economic evaluation of cardiovascular disease prevention in primary care. In 2003 to 2004 he spent a year as a Commonwealth Fund Harkness Fellow in Health Policy in Harvard Medical School.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>From 2005 to 2010 he was Programme Director of the University of Birmingham Master of Public Health. He currently acts as an external examiner for the Imperial College London MPH programme.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>Tom&rsquo;s research interests are diverse. Common themes include his interest in addressing practical and substantial health problems and a focus on primary care. In 2000 his seminal paper on the potential for taxation to influence diet achieved worldwide media coverage and has sparked a number of subsequent papers by other authors. He has published on the use of statistical process control for quality improvement in health care and for monitoring mortality rates in primary care. He has researched patients views and preferences in relation to taking drug treatments to prevent cardiovascular disease. His work on the economics of cardiovascular prevention in primary care has been influential in the 2008 NICE guidelines on lipid lowering. He has published several papers on the effects of variation in the measurement of risk factors on clinical decision making. More recent work has investigated the potential for targeted case finding of patient at high risk of cardiovascular disease using information recorded in electronic primary care records. This is being evaluated in primary care based a cluster randomised controlled trial in the West Midlands. He has also investigated using electronic primary care records for the identification of patients at high risk of suspected colorectal cancer and is interested in making greater use of electronic records to improve patient care. He is currently leading a project to link cancer registry records on colorectal cancer to electronic primary care records.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>Recently he acquired a sub-licence for a large dataset of anonymised electronic primary care records (THIN: The Health Improvement Network <a id=\"CMS_A669c775e759b47548b0a2c00aafac52d\" href=\"http:\/\/www.epic-uk.org\/\">http:\/\/www.epic-uk.org\/<\/a>) and he is keen to undertake collaborative research using this resource.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p><span>Tom is a&nbsp; a reviewer for many grant awarding bodies. He has been a member of the NIHR Research for Patient Benefit grant awarding committee and also was a member of the editorial board of the Health Technology Assessment journal.&nbsp; <\/span><\/p>",

The oil industry studies failed to identify any discernible excess risks of acute myeloid leukaemia although an earlier study Tom carried out into benzene exposed workers from various UK industries in the 1950&rsquo;s and 1960&rsquo;s found a doubling of risk for this leukaemia. It seems likely that exposures in the oil industry were not high enough to cause a discernible problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>",

    "Research": "We are developing novel, gene-based therapies for cancer. One approach uses the enzyme nitroreductase, from E. coli, to activate prodrugs such as CB1954 to cytotoxic derivatives. Our labwork has progressed to early phase clinical trials, injecting an adenovirus vector expressing nitroreductase into tumours. These showed encouraging evidence of localised anti-tumour activity when combined with CB1954, and suggest that further optimisation could lead to an effective treatment for locally relapsed prostate cancer. <br \/> <br \/> Towards this goal, we have developed improved nitroreductase mutants that activate CB1954 more efficiently than the natural enzyme, and collaborate with groups developing better prodrugs. We are also studying viruses that are engineered to replicate in cancer cells, but not in normal cells. Virus replication contributes direct anti-cancer activity, and can also improve the distribution of prodrug-activating enzyme through the cancer. <br \/> <br \/> Stimulation of tumour-specific immune responses could allow a localized gene therapy to have a systemic benefit; we plan to test this by clinical trial of a vector that produces nitroreductase (for CB1954 activation) and the immunostimulatory cytokine GM-CSF. We are also interested in the potential of co-stimulatory proteins (e.g. CD80 and 4-1BBL) to overcome some of the factors that allow tumours to escape immune control.",

    "Research": "<strong>RESEARCH THEMES <br \/><br \/><\/strong>Blood Cell Development, Cell Fate Determination, Leukaemia Cell Biology, Therapeutic Use of Novel Synthetic Retinoids <br \/><br \/><strong>RESEARCH ACTIVITY&nbsp;<br \/><br \/><\/strong>Since 1972, the core aims of my research have been to define the nature of blood cell types, to understand their development and to define the cellular origins of, and possible treatments for, leukaemia and other malignancies. <br \/><br \/><strong>Current research interests: <br \/>Modelling the development of haematopoietic cells <br \/><\/strong>The mammalian blood cell system provides biologists with one of the best models for unravelling how one stem cell &ndash; the haematopoietic stem cell &ndash; gives rise to the many different types of cells of the blood and immune systems. The classic model for this process depicts two families of cells; lymphoid and myeloid. This dichotomy has been increasingly challenged &ndash; and an accumulation of new findings culminated in a Nature commentary suggesting that &ldquo;the latest research will necessitate revision of textbook accounts&rdquo;. I proposed the &lsquo;Pair-Wise Model&rsquo; of haematopoiesis, which is an updated version of my &lsquo;Sequential Determination Model&rsquo; (from 1985). The model groups the pair-wise relationships between lineage fates around a broken circle: to date there aren&rsquo;t findings that refute this model. Ongoing studies are examining whether the Pair-Wise model is a correct representation of haematopoiesis by extending understanding of the events that govern commitment of haematopoietic stem cells to becoming one particular type of cell. <br \/><br \/><strong>Controls on cell behaviour <br \/><\/strong>Endeavours to understand cell differentiation are also focused on signals that arise from all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and vitamin D3 (with Dr Hughes). It is well known that retinoids are important to the development of many tissues. Work has investigated the effects of novel synthetic retinoids that agonize and antagonize sub-types of retinoic acid receptors (RAR), including unique &#61543;-selective compounds, on the growth and differentiation of various normal and malignant cells. Findings are that: (i) RAR antagonists potently induce growth arrest, followed by apoptosis, in patients&rsquo; prostate and colon carcinoma cells and breast carcinoma cell lines, (ii) antagonizing RARs improves the recovery of neutrophils in leukopenic mice and provides protection to these mice from Staphylococcus aureus infection, and (iii) pan-RAR antagonism enhances expansion of haematopoietic stem cells in liquid culture (~40 fold). Current interests are to explore the potential therapeutic uses that are indicated by these findings. Vitamin D3 studies have described the importance of rapid &lsquo;non-genomic&rsquo; responses that involve interaction of the vitamin D3 receptor with &lsquo;non-genomic&rsquo; signalling pathways that are usually growth-factor driven. <br \/><br \/><strong>Previous related research activity: <br \/>The cellular origins of leukaemias <br \/><\/strong>Early work described human B and T lymphocyte antigens which contributed towards the definition of B and T lymphocytes in man, and to the description of B-acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL) and T-ALL. Cells from 76% of childhood and 50% of adult cases of ALL exhibited neither a B nor T cell phenotype. The nature of this leukaemia was resolved by the discovery of the &lsquo;common Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia Antigen&rsquo; (cALLA, now CD10) - the leukaemia is designated common ALL (cALL). Identification of cALLA was a forerunner of the immunophenotyping of leukaemia cells that is now routine clinical practice. <br \/><br \/><strong>A monoclonal antibody approach to the identification of blood cells <br \/><\/strong>With Galfre and Milstein, I produced the first monoclonal antibodies to human cell surface antigens, including the leukocyte common antigen CD45. Subsequently, monoclonal antibodies were produced to MHC class I molecules; various myeloid-associated antigens; the transferrin receptor; a novel haemopoietic precursor cell antigen; the MHC class molecules DR, DP, DQ; a novel nuclear envelope protein; and nucleoplasmin. <br \/><br \/><strong>Fundamental aspects of cellular inositol polyphosphates <br \/><\/strong>Studies of HL60 cells, with Bob Michell, revealed three important characteristics of inositol polyphosphates: (i) they are present in the cytosol of mammalian cells in much larger quantities than the Ca2+-mobilising second messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; (ii) the concentrations of several inositol polyphosphates, especially Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5, increase substantially during myeloid differentiation; and (iii) normal haematopoietic progenitors and malignant cells such as HL60 display similar changes during differentiation. <br \/><br \/><strong>Differentiation and proliferation are separately regulated <br \/><\/strong>I showed that myeloid cells can undergo commitment and differentiation to neutrophils and to monocytes under conditions that permit no proliferation. Moreover, differentiation is initiated rapidly in cells arrested in early G1, at G1\/S or during S phase of cell cycle. These studies revealed that differentiation and proliferation are separate processes that can be concurrently regulated. <br \/><br \/><strong>Novel strategies for differentiation therapy of myeloid leukaemias <br \/><\/strong>ATRA is widely used to treat acute promyelocytic leukaemia. The sensitivity of myeloid cells to ATRA (and to vitamin D3) can be increased by simultaneous treatment with several agents, such as indomethacin. The steroid-metabolizing enzyme aldoketoreductase e, which was cloned with colleagues in Cardiff, is a cellular &lsquo;target&rsquo; for some of the &lsquo;sensitizing&rsquo; agents. Sensitization of leukaemia cells to the differentiative effect of ATRA by inhibiting the activity of aldoketoreductase e provides a novel type of combination differentiation therapy for leukaemias.",

These events occur within the thymus, an organ that provides specialised microenvironments to support the development of mature T-cells from their bone marrow derived precursors. In particular, epithelial cells within the thymus provide essential signals to these migrant precursors that regulate their proliferation, commitment, and differentiation. Defects in thymic epithelial cell development and function are known to be linked to autoimmunity and immunodeficiency, making analysis of these cells important in understanding normal immune system development and function. Specifically, we study:<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p><strong>Thymic Epithelial Cell Development And Function <br \/> <\/strong><br \/> Thymic epithelial cells provide unique environments to support the generation of a self-tolerance T-cell repertoire.

He undertook junior medical posts at the Hammersmith and Royal Brompton hospitals before moving to a MRC Clinical Research Fellowship at UCL. There he worked within the uniquely translational National Amyloidosis Centre\/Centre for Acute Phase Proteins, with Sir Mark Pepys FRS as his supervisor. His PhD was focussed on the development of inhibitors of C-reactive protein. He completed his advanced Gastroenterology and Hepatology training in Cambridge, and was awarded Specialist status in 2007. Until January 2012 he worked in Toronto, Canada, where he was a Staff Physician and Assistant Professor of Medicine at the University Health Network and University of Toronto. During this time he managed one of the largest autoimmune liver disease cohorts in North America, and with his colleague Prof Kathy Siminovitch published the seminal genetic observations underpinning the IL-12 signalling axis as critical to the pathophysiology of primary biliary cirrhosis. He now divides his time between acadaemic translational research in autoimmune liver disease, with a focus towards cholestatic diseases, and his clinical practice at the QE hospital",

    "Biography": "<p>My work thus far has focussed on the cellular contributions to repair following liver injury. This has included hepatocytes, embryonic stem cell derived hepatocytes and bone marrow-derived stem cells. <br \/><br \/>He completed his medical and doctoral training in Edinburgh where he studied the hepatocytic contribution of human stem cells in vitro and also in murine models. As part of this he identified mechanisms regulating hepatocyte adhesion during liver injury. During his clinical training in Edinburgh he established a group which continued studies of human adult and also human embryonic stem (hES) cells. The work with human embryonic stem cell derived hepatocytes has led to the refinement of differentiation protocols such that they are able to reliably produce large numbers of homogeneous cells which have many of the mature functions seen in primary human hepatocytes. This has had immediate implications in their use by pharmaceutical companies for drug testing, and will also be relevant in the context of their use for bio-artificial liver support systems. This is hugely relevant in the arena of hepatocyte transplantation for liver disease, which is currently limited by our inability to ensure adequate engraftment of donor hepatocytes in the diseased liver.<br \/><br \/>He has now established a group in Birmingham which has a major interest in studying the trafficking, engraftment and functional contribution that bone marrow stem cells and hES-derived hepatocytes make to liver injury\/regeneration. This work is funded by way of project grants and clinical training fellowships from the MRC.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>He is also a PI on the NIHR Biomedical Research Unit in Birmingham which includes a trial of haematopoietic stem cells in patients with chronic liver disease (REALISTIC study). He is the Chief Investigator on this trial, which is twinned with Edinburgh, and has started recruitment.&nbsp;He is also the co-Director\/Clinical Director for the Birmingham University Stem Cell Centre (BUSCC).<br \/><br \/>With respect to his clinical practice he is the clinical lead for the metabolic liver service at the Liver Unit in Birmingham. This includes cohorts of patients with Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) tyrosinaemia, glycogen storage disease, porphyria and cystic fibrosis, who are likely candidates for cell therapy in the future. Building on this clinical programme he has developed a research interest in NAFLD which encompasses both basic science and clinical components (funded by Wellcome Trust).<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>Prospective researchers should contact him regarding job\/training opportunities.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>&nbsp;<\/p>",

His doctoral studies where in mechanisms of b-lactamase resistance. He then won a NATO fellowship to Harvard Medical School where he worked from 1984 to 1989. Initially still interested in enzyme mechanisms he soon turned his attention to angiogenesis and angiogenic factors. He returned to the new Institute of Molecular Medicine in Oxford as a group head with the Imperial Cancer Research Fund. He remained in Oxford for fifteen years where he developed an international reputation in the field of Angiogenesis and was in time appointed Professor of Cancer Cell Biology. His early work involved angiogenic factors such as VEGF and thymidine phosphorylase. More recently he became interested in the identification of novel genes involved in endothelial biology and angiogenesis and particularly those that have potential as cancer targets. His group has identified several such genes including Delta4, Robo4, EndoPDI and ECSCR.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>Roy moved to Birmingham in 2005 where he has continued the identification of novel genes and recently developed an interest in modern techniques of genomics including deep sequencing.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>&nbsp;<\/p>",

    "Research": "<p>A characteristic feature of chronic inflammatory reactions is their persistence and predilection for certain sites. Our group investigates the role that tissue resident stromal cells (fibroblasts) play in determining both the switch to persistence as well as the site at which inflammation occurs. In chronic inflammation the resolution phase is prolonged and disordered leading to the persistent accumulation of the inflammatory infiltrate. Our work has allowed us to propose that a stromal area post code, predominantly defined by fibroblasts, exists within tissues. Our hypothesis predicts that components of this stromal area post code become disordered during inflammation, leading to the accumulation of lymphocytes in structures that resemble lymphoid tissues. We have proposed that inflammation is not generic but contextual and therefore differences in the response of different inflammatory diseases to therapy are likely to be due to intrinsic differences in the behavior of stromal cells within different environments. Ignoring the contribution of stromal cells to the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory disease may account for the failure of current therapies to affect a permanent cure. We suggest that stromal cells in general and fibroblasts in particular offer a new family of organ specific targets to treat chronic immune mediated inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>For more information about Chris Buckley's research follow the links below:<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>BBC Radio 4 (2004) Inflammation <br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/radio4\/science\/frontiers_20041020.shtml\" onclick=\"void(window.open('http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/radio4\/science\/frontiers_20041020.shtml','','toolbar=yes,menubar=yes,location=yes,scrollbars=yes,status=yes,resizable=yes'));return false;\" onkeypress=\"void(window.open('http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/radio4\/science\/frontiers_20041020.shtml','','toolbar=yes,menubar=yes,location=yes,scrollbars=yes,status=yes,resizable=yes'));return false;\">http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/radio4\/science\/frontiers_20041020.shtml<\/a>&nbsp;<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>BBC Radio 4 (2008) Inflamed Response <br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/radio4\/inflamedresponse\/pip\/11voq\/\" onclick=\"void(window.open('http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/radio4\/inflamedresponse\/pip\/11voq\/','','toolbar=yes,menubar=yes,location=yes,scrollbars=yes,status=yes,resizable=yes'));return false;\" onkeypress=\"void(window.open('http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/radio4\/inflamedresponse\/pip\/11voq\/','','toolbar=yes,menubar=yes,location=yes,scrollbars=yes,status=yes,resizable=yes'));return false;\">http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/radio4\/inflamedresponse\/pip\/11voq\/<\/a><\/p>",

    "Biography": "Janet Lord began her research career in the field of diabetes, gaining a PhD from the University of Aston in 1983 researching the link between obesity, diabetes and ageing. She went on to investigate signalling pathways involved in regulating insulin secretion, working with Steve Ashcroft at Oxford University, revealing the key role played by protein kinase C in this process. She returned to Birmingham and was awarded a Royal Society University Fellowship in 1989, allowing her to set up her own group looking at cell signalling in immune cells and its dysregulation in disease. She was promoted to the chair in immune cell biology in 2004. <br \/> <br \/> She has made seminal contributions to the field of apoptosis, defining the PKC isoenzyme PKC-delta as an apoptotic lamin kinase and showing for the first time that the very short lifespan of neutrophils was due to their ability to activate death receptor signalling pathways in the absence of death receptor ligation. Her research has identified several novel therapeutic targets based upon the induction of apoptosis, most notably members of the PKC family. <br \/> <br \/> In the last decade she has become interested in the effect of ageing and stress upon neutrophil function, including how innate immunity is regulated by the endocrine system. In 2010 she showed for the first time that the major adrenal steroid dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate was able to enhance neutrophil bactericidal function, revealing a biological function for this hormone distinct from its role as a precursor for the androgen DHEA. Her work suggests that a lack of this hormone in old age results in older adults being more susceptible to the immune suppressive effects of the stress hormone cortisol after physical stress such as hip fracture or the emotional stress of a bereavement.<br \/> <br \/> Professor Lord and her team now focus upon characterising signaling pathways that regulate innate immune cell function, with a special interest in the bactericidal processes and survival of neutrophils. This knowledge is used to develop novel therapies in three main areas; Immune senescence (loss of immune function with ageing), chronic inflammatory disease (Rheumatoid Arthritis) and Acute Myeloid Leukaemia.",

    "Research": "<p><strong>RESEARCH THEMES<\/strong><b><br \/> <br \/> <\/b>The effect of ageing on immunity; chronic inflammation; trauma; &nbsp;stress and immunity&nbsp;<br \/> <br \/> <strong>RESEARCH ACTIVITY<\/strong><b><br \/> <\/b><br \/> <strong>Immune senescence and frailty<\/strong><b><br \/> <\/b>As humans age they become more susceptible to infectious diseases (especially bacterial infections), inflammatory disease, autoimmune disease and have poorer responses to vaccinations. Although ageing is a complex process, these data suggest that immune function may be reduced during ageing and will contribute to the increased morbidity of the elderly. Professor Lord&rsquo;s team has shown that neutrophil function declines with age, specifically that neutrophil phagocytosis of bacteria is reduced by almost half and also that neutrophil migration accuracy is reduced. The latter is important as inefficient migration leads to excess tissue damage as the cell migrates towards a site of infection and this may explain why older people are frailer after infection. &nbsp;The team are now testing interventions to improve neutrophil migration and reduce mortality in patients with pneumonia.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>Prof Lord&rsquo;s studies also aim to determine if stress accelerates this loss of neutrophil function and makes the elderly more susceptible to infection and physical frailty. The research so far has shown that after hip-fracture or bereavement, the loss of neutrophil function is dramatically increased and almost half of hip fracture patients succumbed to serious bacterial infections. Importantly this work has revealed that this may be mediated by an excess of the immune suppressive stress hormone cortisol and a lack of the immune enhancing counter stress hormone dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). A raised cortisol:DHEAS ratio was also associated with poor physical function (frailty) up to 6 months after hip fracture. Professor Lord is now seeking funding to try and supplement hip fracture patients with DHEA to see if the number of infections in these patients can be reduced.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>More recently the team associated with the MRC-ARUK Centre for Musculoskeletal Ageing Research have been studying older adults who have been physically very active all of their lives to determine how much of physical and immune ageing is due to increased inactivity with old age. So far this research has revealed that sarcopenia did not occur in these adults, but other aspects of ageing such as a decline in lung function did. The team are now examining immune function in these adults.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p><strong>Chronic inflammatory disease<\/strong><b><br \/> <\/b>During an immune response inflammatory cells, including T cells and neutrophils, are recruited to sites of infection to help to clear pathogens. Once the site is rendered sterile these same cells must be removed efficiently to avoid non-specific attacks on healthy tissue. This is achieved in part by their death by apoptosis and removal by macrophages. Professor Lord and colleagues has shown that this process is dysregulated in chronic inflammatory diseases such as Rheumatoid arthritis, leading to the accumulation of inflammatory cells and destruction of healthy tissue by cells such as neutrophils. The group has identified signals from stromally derived cytokines (type 1 Interferon and GM-CSF) as regulators of neutrophil survival and stromal fibroblasts are now recognised as rational targets in rheumatoid arthritis.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>This work has now progressed to consider the role of immunesenescence in the development of RA. Previous work by researchers in the US has shown that patients with established RA show features of accelerated immune ageing and Prof Lord has revealed that regulatory B cells, which play a role in preventing autoimmunity, are reduced with age. The team are now working with Prof Karim Raza to determine if immunesenescence appears in the very earliest stages of RA and could be a driver of pathology rather than a consequence.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p><b>Trauma<\/b><\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>Major trauma is accompanied by a significant systemic inflammatory response (SIRS) accompanied by a compensatory anti-inflammatory response (CARS), however there is also major immuneparesis which leaves the patient at risk of infections and sepsis. In addition, both the endocrine (increased cortisol:DHEAS ratio) and inflammatory response promote a catabolic response which combined with immobility leads to dramatic loss of muscle. For the elderly patient that presents problems as the ability to restore muscle mass and strength is compromised with age. Prof Lords team in the SRMRC are following the inflammatory and endocrine response to trauma in young and elderly patients with the aim to develop intervention to improve immunity and reduce muscle loss and frailty after trauma.<\/p>",

Three years later she obtained an academic MD degree with a thesis on the effects of suramin on adrenal function in sleeping sickness and adrenocortical carcinoma. After her core medical training she joined the endocrinology department at the University of Wuerzburg, Germany, where she trained from 1994 to 1998 under the auspices of Professor Bruno Allolio. Supported by a German Research Council Postdoctoral Fellowship Grant she then spent two years in the Molecular Endocrinology Lab of the Dept of Paediatrics at the University of California in San Francisco (UCSF). Following her return to Wuerzburg in 2001 she was appointed Consultant Endocrinologist. She obtained a prestigious Heisenberg Fellowship from the German Research Council and moved to Birmingham in October 2002, initially as a Visiting Senior Research Fellow hosted by Paul Stewart. In 2004, she obtained an MRC Senior Clinical Fellowship and was appointed Senior Lecturer at the University of Birmingham. This was followed by her promotion to Chair of Medicine in 2006 and to Head of Centre in 2008.",

    "Biography": "<p>Despite initial intentions to follow a career in forensic science, Laura carried out a PhD with Professor Richard Wise at Dudley Road Hospital (now City Hospital) in Birmingham. She became fascinated with the world of microbiology especially antibiotic resistance. Her research focuses on how antibiotic resistance arises, defining and characterising clinically relevant mechanisms of resistance in zoonoses such as <em>Salmonella enterica<\/em> and pathogens of the respiratory tract such as <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae<\/em>. Laura&rsquo;s team has provided seminal contributions on antibacterial resistance, and this information has been used globally to aid rational antibiotic use. by clinicians and veterinarians. In particular, her team&rsquo;s pioneering work on resistance to the fluoroquinolone antibiotics showed that bacteria from humans and animals became resistant via the same mechanism due to identical mutations in the same genes. Laura has advised organisations such as the World Health Organisation, and scientific data from her team has been used by national governmental agencies when deciding whether to withdraw the licences of some antibiotics from veterinary medicine. For example, with collaborators, molecular and epidemiological data showed fluoroquinolone use in commercial poultry production led to antibiotic resistant bacteria entering the food chain. Laura&rsquo;s team has also led the way for other scientists in the use of high throughput state of the art technologies to analyse large numbers of clinical isolates of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Laura&rsquo;s current work is in three areas (1) mechanisms of regulation of expression of bacterial efflux pumps and how this impacts upon the biology of the bacterium and so its ability to infect the host, (2) identifying inhibitors of efflux, and (3) genomics of plasmid and chromosomally mediated antibiotic resistance.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>She collaborates widely with other researchers in Birmingham, elsewhere in the UK and overseas; this has included formally funded projects with colleagues in China, Singapore and Canada.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>&nbsp;<\/p>",

This is a growing problem, as more strains of bacteria become resistant to the drugs that were primarily developed more than 20 years ago. Her research focuses on how antibiotic resistance arises, and defining and characterising mechanisms of resistance that have a clinical relevance.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>She is also exploring the role of antibiotic resistance mechanisms in the ability of the organism to colonise, survive and cause infection in their host. Laura is particularly interested in the systems that allow transport of antibiotics into and out of bacteria. Adaptations to these systems occur in bacteria and cause multiple drug resistance. Although this work has many applications, Laura has made particularly detailed studies of food borne bacteria such as <em>Salmonella<\/em> and <em>Campylobacter<\/em>, and the pneumococcus that causes pneumonia.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>Current work is in three areas (1) mechanisms of regulation of expression of bacterial efflux pumps and how this impacts upon the ability of the bacterium to infect the host, (2) identifying inhibitors of efflux, and (3) genomics of plasmid and chromosomally mediated antibiotic resistance.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>Laura receives support for her research from the MRC, BBSRC, NIHR and Public Health England. Since 1985 Laura has successfully supervised 28 PhD projects.

    "Biography": "<p>Following completion of his PhD in 1976, John joined the Scientific Civil Service as an urban planning researcher at the Building Research Establishment (then part of the Department of the Environment) where he was promoted twice in three years.&nbsp;But the arrival of Mrs Thatcher in Downing Street signalled more difficult times ahead for research in government, so John looked for an opportunity to return to academia &ndash; but one that would satisfy his interests in applied public policy research.&nbsp;INLOGOV, at the University of Birmingham, was well known to him and seemed an ideal working environment for his interests; so he had no hesitation in applying for a lectureship there when he spotted a recruitment advert.&nbsp;He was delighted to be appointed and has thoroughly enjoyed his subsequent thirty five years there.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>Although at the time of his appointment his research interests and experience were primarily focused on housing and planning, in his first year at Birmingham he was asked if he might take on a project with colleagues in the Law Faculty on the organisation of the magistrates' courts of Hampshire, to which he agreed, thereby opening a door to a new specialism for him &ndash; of judicial administration and the management and governance of court systems.&nbsp;The project led to many similar commissions by local court services, as well from the Home Office, and to John becoming something of a national specialist in judicial administration.&nbsp;<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>With time, his criminal justice horizons have broadened; for example, he became involved in work on the probation service (taking on the editorship of the journal '<i>Vista: Perspective on Probation'<\/i> and serving as a member of the editorial board for the <i>European Probation Journal<\/i>).&nbsp;He also undertook a major research study for the national charity Victim Support evaluating a set of pilot initiatives in introducing a witness care service at the Crown Court &ndash; the success of which led to a national roll-out.&nbsp;Then research opportunities arose in relation to police governance and accountability and much of his recent work has been on the advent of police and crime commissioners in England and Wales.&nbsp;<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>In 2002 he was invited to serve on the newly established Criminal Justice Council for England and Wales &ndash; chaired by a senior high court judge and a body that provides oversight and scrutiny of new proposals and developments in criminal justice.&nbsp;He has served as a Council member ever since.&nbsp;<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>In addition, he retains strong research interests in local government and public management and governance more generally.&nbsp;He is a member of the editorial board of the <i>International Journal of Public Administration<\/i>, and has undertaken several studies of local authority regulatory functions &ndash; a subject that links well with his interests in criminal justice.&nbsp;&nbsp;His knowledge of and interests in local government also benefit from his practical involvement as a Green councillor &ndash; from 1995 at parish level in his home area; then from 200 onwards as a district councillor; and more recently (since May 2013) as a county councillor as well.<\/p>",

He also has practical experience of local government, having served as a parish councillor (1995-2000); as a district councillor since 2000, and as a county councillor since 2013.&nbsp;<\/p>",

How is this linked to its past\/current\/future work on (good) governance, and anti-corruption work in particular? What are the political implications of donors&rsquo; state-building activities, both for donors themselves and in country? How is this linked to a politicisation of aid, from the project level on up?<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>&nbsp;(2)&nbsp; Attitudes towards corruption in developing countries: how are attitudes towards corruption formed? Can the same processes be (re)shaped in a way that improves attitudes towards integrity? How best to theorise the impact of attitudes on policy success\/failure - i.e., collective action theory and moral disengagement theory? How do attitudes towards corruption affect levels of (political) trust in a society? How do attitudes towards corruption shape the state-building process?

Politics of Faith and Disbelief in Post-modernity<\/b><\/li>\u000d\u000a<\/ul>\u000d\u000a<p>The monograph assesses the implications of the publication in 2007 of Mother Teresa's private correspondence (in which she confesses her lack of faith in God from 1940 until her death in 1997) for her legacy, and in the context of creationist and evolutionist views on the role of religion in post-modernity. The study highlights similarities and differences between Mother Teresa's \"dark night of the soul\" and the spiritual darkness experienced by medieval writers such as Richeldis of Faverches and Hidegard of Bingen as well as St John of the Cross, St Teresa of &Aacute;vila and St Th&eacute;r&egrave;se of Lisieux.

The monograph draws attention for the first time to the work of 'unknown' European scholars and intellectuals, such as F. Nopcsa and F. Konica, who expressed concerns about the fading aura in the art of dressing almost four decades before Walter Benjamin and other members of the Frankfurt School articulated their concerns about the relationship between the capitalist mode of production and standardization of tastes in the late 1930s. The study assesses the importance European nationalists attached to the national costume towards the end of the nineteenth century and at the start of the twentieth century.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<ul>\u000d\u000a<li><b>In God's Image: The Sociology of Authorship<\/b><\/li>\u000d\u000a<\/ul>\u000d\u000a<p>The monograph critically assesses key modernist and postmodernist theories of authorship, concentrating on Foucault's analysis of the 'author-function' in Western culture and the impact of Derrida's and Barthes' views on deconstruction, 'la mort de l'auteur', and the 'supremacy' of the reader on the authorship debate over the last fifty years. The study approaches the author in the context of 'pre\/romantic', 'elitist' and 'populist' views concentrating on the im\/personal, attached \/ detached, therapeutic and autobiographical aspects of writing<\/p>",

    "Biography": "<p>Luis Cabrera&rsquo;s research has focused on institutional changes above the nation-state to promote the protection of human rights. His most recent book, The Practice of Global Citizenship (Cambridge University Press 2010), seeks to identify the universal human duties that correspond to individual economic and political rights. His theoretical claims were informed by extensive field work at sites of intense unauthorised immigration in the United States, Mexico, and Western Europe.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>The book was awarded the inaugural Yale H. Ferguson prize by the International Studies Association-Northeast. The U.S.-based association established the prize to recognize the work each year &lsquo;that most advances the vibrancy of international studies as a pluralist discipline&rsquo;.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>His 2004 book, Political Theory of Global Justice, offered an argument based in distributive justice for democratically accountable political integration above the state, up to some form of fully global government. His current book project, The Possibility of Global Political Community, seeks to identify best practices for suprastate democracy through giving fine-grained attention to democracy under conditions of deep diversity in such states as India, and within the European Union.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>Before turning to academics full time, Dr. Cabrera worked as a staff reporter for The Associated Press in Seattle (USA), covering criminal justice issues, politics, the anti-corporate-globalisation movement, the Seattle music scene, and the NBA Seattle SuperSonics. He is an associate staff member of Birmingham&rsquo;s Centre for the Study of Global Ethics<\/p>",

A key issue being Clausewitz&rsquo;s argument that to remove the &lsquo;political&rsquo; element from an act of war renders the act meaningless.

Therefore, my current research focuses upon the warfare between the Chiricahua Apaches, led by Victorio and Nana, and the USA and Mexico during the late 1870s and early 1880s. This leads on to a long-term project to analyse &lsquo;American Indian&rsquo; policy-making processes in Washington D.C. during the period 1864-1890 with a view to drawing parallels with contemporary events.<\/p>",

    "Research": "<h3>Counter-terrorism and terrorism<\/h3> <p>One of my current teaching and research interests relates to counterterrorism and terrorism. My book The British War on Terror: Terrorism and Counterterrorism on the Home Front since 9-11 was published in January 2008. I have also done research related to American counterterrorism policy, specifically the State Department's Rewards for Justice program, the origins of which lie in 1984 and the Reagan administration. This interest emanates from research on state informers that I describe below. I am currently interested in working on a history of domestic British counter-terrorism.&nbsp;<\/p> <h3>Security and intelligence<\/h3> <p>In January 2010, my new history of informers was published. Even before September 11, books and popular culture have focused on technology as being the chief threat to civil liberties through state and private surveillance. Lost in the shuffle has been the human factor, namely the reality that some individuals actively assist the state, be it in police forces or intelligence services, by supplying information on others. The book is entitled Snitch!: A History of the Modern Intelligence Informer. My previous work looked at the history of state surveillance in a Canadian context, in particular the spying by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police at Canadian universities for over eighty years.<\/p> <h3>Canadian security and intelligence and Canadian studies<\/h3> <p>In collaboration with Professor Christabelle Sethna of the Institute of Women&rsquo;s Studies at the University of Ottawa, I am working on a project entitled &ldquo;Sex Spying&rdquo; that will investigate state surveillance in Canada of women&rsquo;s organizations from the 1960s until the 1980s. We are currently under contract by McGill-Queen's University Press to produce a monograph on the topic. Eventually, we hope to broaden this project into a comparative examination of state surveillance of women&rsquo;s organizations in both Canada and the U.S.<\/p> <h3>Anti-Americanism<\/h3> <p>As a Canadian I am, according to historian Frank Underhill, \"the first anti-American, the model anti-American, the archetypal anti-American, the ideal anti-American as he exists in the mind of God.\" Thus, by birth I have an interest in this topic, as I do with the wider nature of Canadian-American relations. Of particular interest to me in terms of research is not just anti-Americanism, but the negative response by some in the United States or elsewhere to criticism of the U.S. I call this anti-Anti-Americanism (&copy; Steve Hewitt) and I am interested in the gendered and ideological nature of this backlash against the backlash.<\/p> <p><iframe src=\"\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/LoPowN5pdv4?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"510\" height=\"287\">&nbsp;<\/iframe><\/p>",

This work began with a clinical characterisation study of UK families, then a genetic linkage analysis, demonstrating autosomal recessive inheritance and narrowing the candidate gene region on chromosome 4p.&nbsp;Once the gene was identified, he published a mutation analysis of UK patients. Key discoveries include: (i) the demonstration of autosomal recessive inheritance as opposed to mitochondrial inheritance; (ii) narrowing of the locus on chromosome 4p from 7Mb to 4Mb of DNA; (iii) definition of the mutational spectrum of the <em>wfs1 <\/em>gene in the pathogenesis of Wolfram syndrome; (iv) functional studies demonstrating the sodium pump as a novel interacting partner. Professor Barrett&rsquo;s lab is part of Medical and Molecular Genetics (head, Prof Eamonn Maher), in the Institute of Biomedical Research at The Medical School in Edgbaston.&nbsp;<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>Work on other rare diabetes syndromes has included a contributions to identifying the genes for Thiamine responsive megaloblastic anaemia, diabetes and deafness; and the gene for Wolcott Rollison syndrome. Mutation analyses and clinical studies have been published for both these syndromes and for Alstrom syndrome and congenital hypopituitarism secondary to mutations in the PROP1 and PIT1 genes. The Alstrom syndrome study was the first to demonstrate insulin resistance in affected children out of proportion to the fat mass. Each of these studies led to the establishment of molecular genetic testing as NHS services (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bwhct.nhs.uk\/genetics-index.htm\" onclick=\"void(window.open('http:\/\/www.bwhct.nhs.uk\/genetics-index.htm','','toolbar=yes,menubar=yes,location=yes,scrollbars=yes,status=yes,resizable=yes'));return false;\" onkeypress=\"void(window.open('http:\/\/www.bwhct.nhs.uk\/genetics-index.htm','','toolbar=yes,menubar=yes,location=yes,scrollbars=yes,status=yes,resizable=yes'));return false;\">http:\/\/www.bwhct.nhs.uk\/genetics-index.htm<\/a>)<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p><strong>National and International rare disease registries<\/strong><\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>He has also been involved over the last 2 years in a Big Lottery funded study establishing a national disease registry for Alstrom syndrome.

After lecturing at the Queen&rsquo;s University, Belfast, he moved to the University of Birmingham in 1973. He has edited chamber duets and cantatas by Agostino Steffani (two volumes, published by Garland and A-R Editions) and also, in collaboration with Lowell Lindgren (MIT), edited the composer&rsquo;s correspondence with Giuseppe Riva. His monograph on Steffani&rsquo;s life and works, <em>Polymath of the Baroque<\/em> (Oxford University Press, 2003), won the British Academy&rsquo;s Derek Allen Prize. Having published on other composers, such as Corelli, Vivaldi and Marcello, he contributed forty articles to <em>The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians<\/em>. His research extends also to Alessandro Stradella (editions of cantatas and of an oratorio for the Edizione Nazionale of his <em>opera omnia<\/em>, of which he is a board member) and to Handel (edition of <em>Theodora<\/em> for the Hallische H&auml;ndel-Ausgabe). His course on editing is a distinctive feature of his specialist teaching, which deals with topics from the fifteenth to the nineteenth century. He has conducted many concerts of vocal and orchestral music, including performances of Handel&rsquo;s <em>Solomon<\/em> and <em>Jephtha<\/em>, Bach&rsquo;s <em>St John Passion<\/em> and <em>B-minor Mass<\/em>, the Verdi <em>Requiem<\/em>, Elgar&rsquo;s <em>The Dream of Gerontius<\/em>, Tippett&rsquo;s <em>Child of Our Time<\/em> and Britten&rsquo;s <em>War Requiem<\/em>.

Here, he pioneered the application of metabolomics to environmental health issues in aquatic organisms.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>In 2003 he relocated to the University of Birmingham as a NERC Advanced Fellow with the remit to further develop metabolomics in environmental toxicology. With funding from the NERC, BBSRC, MRC, Wellcome Trust, Wolfson Foundation, EU, Environment Agency and several US agencies, Viant has established a large and active research group in environmental metabolomics. In 2008 he was appointed to Reader in Metabolomics, in 2009 became the Director of the NERC Biomolecular Analysis Facility for Metabolomics, and in 2010 secured his current Chair in Metabolomics. He has served as the President of the international Metabolomics Society since 2012. His achievements in metabolomics research have recently been recognised by the University of Birmingham&rsquo;s highest award, the Joseph Chamberlain Award for Academic Advancement (2013).<\/p>",

One of my group's research goals is to develop tools based around high resolution mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy for identifying and quantifying the metabolite profiles of tissues and biofluids. We have developed methods in 2-dimensional NMR, confirmed the high reproducibility of NMR metabolomics in an international intercomparison study, and developed new software tools for data mining <em>J<\/em>-resolved NMR spectra. Also, we have and continue to develop metabolomic methods in high resolution direct infusion mass spectrometry and LC-MS, including tools for metabolite identification and optimal signal processing and analysis pipelines (primarily with Dr Warwick Dunn).<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p><strong><em>Environmental toxicology<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>My group focuses primarily on using metabolomics to characterise the molecular responses of aquatic animals, in particular invertebrates, to environmental pollutants. We are not only interested in the molecular mechanisms, but also to investigate the utility of metabolomics and targeted metabolite analyses as diagnostic tools for both environmental monitoring and chemical risk assessment. We have used metabolomics to probe toxicant induced metabolic changes in a range of organisms, in particular marine mussels, water fleas (<em>Daphnia magna<\/em>) and several fish species.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>Most notably, our research has led to the discovery of biomarkers of toxic stress that are predictive of whole organism physiological perturbation. This work has received &ldquo;Honorable Mention&rdquo; from the Society of Toxicology as one of the top 5 papers published in <em>Toxicological Sciences<\/em> in 2010.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>Currently, two areas of research that are expanding within my group include the study into the potential toxicities of engineered nanomaterials (primarily with Professor Kevin Chipman) and the application of metabolomics to increase our understanding of the molecular machinary within&nbsp;<em>Daphnia magna<\/em>&nbsp;and its response to environmental stress (primarily with Professor John Colbourne). Overall we seek to gain an improved mechanistic understanding of the effects of environmental insults on organisms, and ultimately to develop tools to monitor the health of our environment.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p><iframe src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/RU0PTuW4N64?rel=0\" height=\"287\" width=\"510\">&nbsp;<\/iframe><br \/> Mark Viant describes, in 60 seconds,&nbsp;his research in the area of measuring environmental stress by studying animals at the molecular level<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p><strong><em>Human disease<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\u000d\u000a<p><a title=\"Systems Sciences for Health\" href=\"http:\/\/www.ssfh.bham.ac.uk\/\">Systems Science for Health<\/a> (SSfH) is a University initiative that is applying the latest omics technologies as well as mathematical and computational approaches to the study of human disease.

    "Research": "Michael's current research is on moral education. His project is&nbsp;to develop a theory of cognitive moral education, an account of whether and how moral beliefs should be imparted to students.&nbsp;A pressing question is whether cognitive moral education can avoid indoctrination. Is it possible to impart moral beliefs in such a way that they are held on the basis of appropriate and sufficient reasons, or is the process of moral belief transmission necessarily subrational and manipulative?&nbsp;The idea pursued in the project is that moral beliefs can be robustly justified with reference to their success in alleviating what David Copp has called the &lsquo;problem of sociality&rsquo;, and that students can be brought to hold moral beliefs on that basis. Roughly, the problem of sociality is the permanent threat to social cooperation posed by human vulnerability, limited resources and limited sympathies, and moral beliefs are justified when widespread subscription to the standards they articulate reliably averts that threat. The claim that this way of justifying moral beliefs is an appropriate foundation for non-indoctrinatory cognitive moral education does not rule out the possibility of there being other successful approaches to moral belief justification.",

    "Biography": "<p>Catherine Durose is Director of Research and Knowledge Transfer for the School of Government and Society at the University of Birmingham and Senior Lecturer in the Institute for Local Government Studies.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>Catherine has previously held an Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) studentship at the University of Manchester and a Research Councils UK (RCUK) Fellowship and a Senior Research Fellowship at De Montfort University. Catherine has also held International Visiting Research Fellowships at the Great Cities Institute, University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) and the Institute for Governance and Policy at the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB), with forthcoming Fellowships at Tilburg University&rsquo;s School of Politics and Public Administration, and the University of Melbourne&rsquo;s School of Government. Catherine is Editor-in-Chief of Local Government Studies, the leading ISI-ranked journal in its inter-disciplinary field and&nbsp;is a member of the Editorial Advisory Board&nbsp;of Policy &amp; Politics.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>Catherine&rsquo;s research focuses on the politics, policies and practices of community, participation and co-production, fields in which she is recognised as a leading international scholar. Catherine has led and been involved in over 20 research projects in these areas, attracting a research income in excess of &pound;2.35 million and supported by the ESRC, Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) Connected Communities programme, the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG), the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) and other public bodies. Catherine is involved in a major new research project funded by the ESRC&rsquo;s Urban Transformations programme, &lsquo;Jam and Justice: co-producing urban governance for social innovation&rsquo;, which aims to create a unique space for social innovation to co-produce, test and learn from new ways of governing cities. <br \/>Building on her co-edited collection, &lsquo;Changing Local Government, Changing Citizens&rsquo; (Policy Press 2009), Catherine&rsquo;s co-authored book, &lsquo;Designing Public Policy for Co-Production&rsquo; (Policy Press\/ University of Chicago Press 2015) will be published later this year. This innovative book challenges the inadequacies and limits of conventional policy design in addressing many of the complex challenges we face as a society, opening up a conversation about how to imagine, experiment and realise a radically democratic alternative form of policy design: co-production. Catherine&rsquo;s further work has been published in journals such as Public Administration, Political Studies, Community Development Journal, Parliamentary Affairs and Environment and Planning C. Her work is forthcoming in Policy &amp; Politics, Evidence &amp; Policy and Public Administration Review. Catherine also researches and has published on other issues including, local governance, regeneration, neighbourhood working, localism, devolution, public service reform, institutional design and participatory research practice.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>Catherine&rsquo;s research generates impact beyond academia and she continues to advise local and national government, public bodies and community organisations on participation and community action. Catherine has held advisory roles for the Department for Communities and Local Government on participatory budgeting, neighbourhood community budgets and neighbourhood working. Catherine was also Independent Advisor to the Office of Civil Society&rsquo;s evaluation of the Community Organisers and Community First Neighbourhood Match Fund initiatives. <br \/>Catherine also initiated and now convenes the Birmingham Citizens Academic Group at the University of Birmingham. Birmingham Citizens - a chapter of Citizens UK &ndash; are an alliance of education, community, trade union and faith-based organisations in the city, committed to using community organising to generate collective power for social change. The involvement of the College of Social Sciences with Birmingham Citizens as a Principal Member, allows colleagues to: connect with the city and its different communities, delivering on the civic purpose of the university; generate opportunities for students to engage in local projects, placements, research and political life; and use research on civil society, health and social care, education and enterprise and other subjects to contribute to campaigns for social justice in the city. Catherine was invited to join Birmingham Citizens Leadership group in March 2015 and the Citizens UK National Council in June 2015. Catherine is now also a Trustee of Langworthy Cornerstone Association in Salford.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>Catherine initiated and now co-convenes the Win: Win network at the University of Birmingham, providing a space, primarily for academic and academic-related women, to develop reciprocal support and facilitate action on issues of gender, career development and leadership. Since its inception, the network has widened its reach and is now launching an ambitious project, the Win: Win 2018 Manifesto to mark the centenary of the Representation of the People Act by contributing and calling for change on issues of gender equality in higher education.<\/p>",

Jam and Justice: Co-Producing Urban Governance for Social Innovation aims to create a unique space for social innovation to co-produce, test and learn from new ways of governing cities. &lsquo;Jam&rsquo; is about trying to bring together different partners in the city to experiment and innovate to address shared problems. &lsquo;Justice&rsquo; is about re-connecting with those who have been disenfranchised and excluded from the search for solutions.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>Through the development of an Action Research Cooperative (ARC) in Greater Manchester, the project aims to bring together academics, practitioners, citizens and political leaders to exchange knowledge and develop creative responses to emerging urban governance challenges.

This will enable critical reflection on how to organise knowledge better to make positive urban transformations happen that are inclusive and equitable.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>January 2016 to January 2019; Co-Investigator (Principal Investigator, Beth Perry, University of Salford with Liz Richardson, University of Manchester and Alex Whinnom, Greater Manchester Centre for Voluntary Organisation).<\/p>\u000d\u000a<ul>\u000d\u000a<li>&lsquo;Who is accountable in localism?&rsquo; follow-on (ESRC Impact Accelerator Pilot, February to July 2014; Co-Investigator (Principal Investigator, Liz Richardson, University of Manchester with Jess Steele, Locality\/ Jericho Road, Ben Lee, National Association for Neighbourhood Management)<\/li>\u000d\u000a<li>Translation across borders: exploring the use, relevance and impact of academic research in the policy process (Arts and Humanities Research Council Connected Communities programme, from February 2014; Co-Investigator, Principal Investigator, Stephen Connelly, University of Sheffield with Dave Vanderhoven, University of Sheffield, Liz Richardson, University of Manchester, Peter Matthews, Herriot Watt University, Robert Rutherfoord\/ Tom Tolfree, Department for Communities and Local Government)<\/li>\u000d\u000a<li>Making a difference in urban neighbourhoods: a cross-national comparative Q-methodology survey (European Research Initiative, from May 2013; with Stephen Jeffares, University of Birmingham, Merlijn van Hulst\/ Laurens de Graaf, Tilburg University, Annika Agger, Roskilde University, Oliver Escobar, University of Edinburgh)<\/li>\u000d\u000a<li>Interrogating Urban Crisis: Governance, Contestation and Critique (Urban Studies, from September 2013; Co-Investigator, Principal Investigator, Jonathan Davies, De Montfort University with Steven Griggs, De Montfort University, Ismael Blanco, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Jill Gross, CUNY and Helen Sullivan, University of Melbourne)<\/li>\u000d\u000a<li>Ways of Knowing: exploring the different registers, values and subjectivities of collaborative research (Arts and Humanities Research Council: Connected Communities programme, February 2013 to January 2014; Co-Investigator, Principal Investigator, Helen Graham, University of Leeds)<\/li>\u000d\u000a<li>Community Governance in a Context of Decentralisation (Arts and Humanities Research Council: Connected Communities programme, November 2012 to April 2013; Principal Investigator with Liz Richardson University of Manchester, Matthew Hilton, University of Birmingham)<\/li>\u000d\u000a<li>Re-defining Service Delivery (Arts and Humanities Research Council: Connected Communities programme, November 2012 to April 2013; Principal Investigator with Catherine Needham, Catherine Mangan, James Rees, Matthew Hilton, University of Birmingham)<\/li>\u000d\u000a<li>Evaluation of Community Organisers and Community First (Office of Civil Society, Cabinet Office, November 2012 to February 2015; Independent Advisor, with IPSOS MORI and nef consulting)<\/li>\u000d\u000a<li>Reframing Citizen-State Relationships in a Time of Austerity: Community Empowerment in England and Scotland(Arts and Humanities Research Council: Connected Communities programme, January 2012 to December 2012; Co-Investigator, Principal Investigator, Joe Painter, University of Durham with Tony Bovaird, University of Birmingham, Annette Hastings, University of Glasgow, Peter Matthews Herriot Watt University and Katie Schmuecker, IPPR North)<\/li>\u000d\u000a<li>Beyond the State?

    "Biography": "<p>Stuart Egginton qualified with a BSc (Hons) in Zoology from the University of Wales (Bangor) in 1977, with experience working at the Universities of Bristol and Helsinki, before studying for a PhD in Physiology at St Andrews University where he was awarded a Maitland-Ramsay Fellowship. Stuart was awarded a personal Research Fellowship to work in the USA (Maine) before coming to Birmingham to join the Department of Physiology as a Post Doc in 1985. After another personal Fellowship held in School of Biological Sciences, Stuart returned to Physiology as a Lecturer in 1989, and has continued to work there since. He studies the stimuli inducing blood vessel growth (angiogenesis), and the mechanisms underlying cardiorespiratory control, in health and disease.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>His contribution to <em>in vivo<\/em> experimental techniques and contributions to biomedical research have been acknowledged with the conferment of a President's Medal by the Society for Experimental Biology (1990), and holding the position of Visiting Professor at the University of Salzburg, Austria (1997-1998), Erskine Fellow at the University of Canterbury, New Zealand (1998-1999), and Honorary Research Fellow in the Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford (from 2009). Stuart was awarded a DSc in 2008.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>He has been a member of grant awarding panels of the Natural Environment Research Council, and is a regular reviewer for BBSRC, BHF, MRC, NSF and Wellcome Trust grants. His scholarship lead has been recognised by appointment as editor for a number of learned journals: Microcirculation (2003-2010), Experimental Physiology (initially 2006-2009, extended to 2012), Frontiers in Vascular Physiology and Frontiers in Aquatic Physiology (both 2010-2013). He has acted as external assessor for various institutes and departments, as well as examining postgraduate degrees, in the UK and abroad.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>In the wider academic circles, Stuart has been elected to Councils of the SEB (1996-2003), British Microcirculation Society (1999-2003), The Physiological Society (2009-2012), and was recently elected President of the BMS (2011-2014). He was elected to Fellowship of the Institute for Learning and Teaching in Higher Education in 2002 (later, Fellow of the Higher Education Academy, 2007) in recognition of breadth and innovation in his teaching. Stuart is a committed participant in the Public Understanding of Science initiative, regularly giving talks to schools and community groups, is the College liaison with Understanding Animal Research, and is a STEM Ambassador for Birmingham.

    "Research": "<p>Stuart&rsquo;s group studies the mechanisms of blood vessel growth, using physiological remodelling to devise targetted therapeutic repair of a pathologically damaged microcirculation, and how interactions between the cardiovascular and respiratory systems are controlled in hypothermia, showing how its deleterious effects may be ameliorated and lead to safe interventions involving therapeutic bradycardia. The multidisciplinary approach ranges from mathematical modelling and bioinformatic network analysis, through cell and molecular assays, to <em>in vivo<\/em> tissue performance and integrative function in a range of animal species and man. These experiments explore the limits to physiological adaptation, and the origins of human morbidity.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>1) Angiogenesis<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>The Angiogenesis Research Group is studying the mechanisms underlying growth of blood vessels in skeletal and cardiac muscle, with a particular emphasis on determining how mechanical factors (i.e. the local physical environment of endothelial cells) may initiate and control the proliferation of capillaries during <em>in vivo<\/em> angiogenesis. Currently under investigation is how increased blood flow (elevated shear stress) and muscle overload (increased longitudinal strain) lead to different patterns of growth originating at the inner (luminal) and outer (abluminal) surfaces, respectively. The combination of local factors invoked during muscle activity is compared with those seen during alterations in the external environment (e.g. hypoxia, hypothermia), including the differential influence of humoral and perivascular signals. These data are essential for the development of angiotherapies to promote regulated vascular growth or controlled vascular rarefaction, as required. This work has widespread implications - some estimates suggest 80% of NHS medical burden could benefit from targetted angiotherapy.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>Important developments include the observations that capillary growth can be induced with or without breakage of the basement membrane, endothelial proliferation may precede the formation of sprouts, the lack of involvement of FGF, and that VEGF, NO and metalloproteinases may differentially regulate physiological angiogenesis. These findings do not conform to the patterns established for pathological or <em>in vitro<\/em> models of angiogenesis. Further studies to elucidate this distinction include the role of stromal cells (pericytes, fibroblasts, macrophages) in controlling angiogenesis, and the link between small and large vessel growth. Exciting new avenues for angiotherapy being explored include manipulation of the HIF transcription pathway, the potential role for stem cells in treatment of muscle ischaemia (using endothelial progenitors), and how mobilisation of other blood components (platelets, leukocytes) may affect the angiogenic response to physiological or pathological stimuli.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>2) Oxygen transport<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>The responses to impaired blood flow or increased activity are used to examine how oxygen supply and demand are balanced. Analysis of capillary distribution within heterogeneous tissue (e.g. muscle with different fibre types) utilises morphometric quantification of capillary supply among fibres in terms of 'supply equivalents'. Scaling of capillary supply with respect to fibre size is the usual pattern observed in skeletal muscle of all vertebrates, and this basic growth process may be modified to a limited extent with training or under pathological conditions (see above). This work identifies the need for tight spatial organisation of adaptive angiogenesis. Complimentary to the extracellular diffusion distances described in this manner, changes to intracellular oxygen tension are examined using mathematical models to examine the relative efficiency of different changes in the pathway of oxygen transport to tissue. Bioinformatic analysis of complex diseases, those with central and peripheral components involving impaired oxygen transport, is used to explore the possibility of better targetted treatment for established co-morbidities (e.g. heart failure, respiratory disease).<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>3) Muscle plasticity<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>The metabolic and ultrastructural responses of skeletal muscle to chronic reduction in blood flow or increased activity are followed in order to identify the range of strategies available to balance nutrient supply and demand. Work on chronic ischaemia is continuing to examine the apparent dissociation between structural and functional damage to the endothelium, and impairment of vascular reactivity liked with NO production. Glycolytic and oxidative muscles respond differently to similar stimuli, although metabolic and structural indices of aerobic capacity are closely related in most, but not all, cases (e.g. capillary supply and oxidative capacity may be varied independently, and localised interventions may have significant remote effects). Adaptations examined include myopathic and training responses in humans; electrical stimulation and ischaemia in mammals; steroid and overload hypertrophy in mammals; migratory fitness in a range of vertebrate species.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>4) Cardiorespiratory control<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>How well the cardiovascular system copes with reduced core temperature has major implications for survival in all vertebrates, and use of clinically invoked hypothermia. Using a specially designed environmental chamber (photoperiod and temperature control), the strategies adopted by species that adapt to a cold environment are compared with the more limited tolerance of other mammals (including man). The cardiovascular response of hibernators to hypothermia examines angiogenic potential, vascular reactivity and cardiac autonomic control mechanisms; this has required development of new software (for power spectral analysis) and hardware (data loggers for long term storage), with potentially broad application. Ectotherms from polar &amp; tropical environments provide additional insights into the physiological limits to life on the edge from an evolutionary perspective. Identifying the preserved or ancestral mechanisms will define the most robust, and therefore likely profitable, avenues for therapeutic intervention.<\/p>",

    "Research": "<p>My research interests lie mainly in the history of nineteenth and twentieth century European imperialisms, decolonization and post-colonialism, with particular emphasis on the popular reception of imperialism and Empire-related subjects in the metropolitan centres.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>My doctoral research looked at the processes of selection, construction and promotion of colonial heroes in Britain and in France between 1870 and the Second World War. It has led me to consider the variety of media which were used to promote the imperial idea in the metropolises, the networks of producers and systems of patronage which sustained them, and the reception of heroic propaganda by various types of audience. Drawing upon a variety of unpublished archives, it also analysed the various political, economic and individual interests which these cultural constructions served. This research has given rise to my book <em>Heroic Imperialists in Africa: The Promotion of British and French Colonial Heroes, 1870-1939.<\/em><\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>I also work on the legacy of Europe&rsquo;s colonial past upon the EU and in its relations with the rest of the world. Developing comparative approaches to European imperialisms allows us to evaluate the extent to which colonial expansion stemmed from a core of shared assumptions and values while exacerbating political and economic rivalries, and how these conflicting roots and effects are negotiated in the post-colonial world against which the EU took shape. As part of this strand, I have co-edited with Kalypso Nicolaidis and Gabi Maas <em>Echoes Of Empire: Memory, Identity and the Legacy of Imperialism.&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>I am the Principal Investigator of the AHRC-funded research project (2012-16) 'Outposts of Conquest: the History and Legacy of the Fortresses of the Steppe and the Sahara in Comparative Perspective, from the 1840s to the present-day'. Through the case-study of colonial fortifications, this joint project with Alexander Morrison (Nazarbayev University, Kazakhstan) analyses the strategies of conquest and administration of two Christian powers which encroached at roughly the same time into arid environments populated by predominantly Muslim nomads. More information on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.birmingham.ac.uk\/forts\">www.birmingham.ac.uk\/forts<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>I am the co-investigator of the AHRC-funded 'Hero Project' (2015-16), which explores and re-appraises the role of the hero in twenty-first century Britain. Working with Abbie Garrington (University of Newcastle, principal investigator) and Natasha Danilova (University of Aberdeen, co-investigator), I am particularly interested in the place of the British imperial hero in the post-colonial age.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>On a more general level, I am interested in the history of Third- and Fourth-Republic France, and in Franco-British relations since the mid-nineteenth century. My next project looks at the practice and effects of colonial and post-colonial photography in Africa from the 1860s until the 1970s.&nbsp;<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>I am a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society, the Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute of British Geographers) and the Higher Education Academy, and I am a member of the AHRC's Peer Review College (2012-15).

After completing her Masters, she secured an ESRC doctoral fellowship to complete her PhD at Warwick on the training of complementary and alternative medical practitioners. The thesis, entitled &lsquo;Knowing the body and embodying knowledge&rsquo; contributed to the fields of embodied sociology, the sociology of knowledge and the sociology of health and healthcare.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>She moved back to London, and worked at the University of Westminster, teaching Public Health and taking up a Research Fellow position in the iCAM Unit (integrating complementary and alternative medicine), where she worked on a number of projects related to clinical governance and safety in CAM practice. During this time, she also held a Visiting Lecturer position at Birkbeck, University of London, where she taught Health Policy. In 2009, she moved back to the Midlands, to take up a Research Fellow position at the School of Health and Population Sciences at the University of Birmingham, working for the NIHR Collaborations for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care (CLARHC) for Birmingham and the Black Country.

I coined the term &lsquo;situated interviewing&rsquo; to describe a method of interviewing that drew on these principles but was also feasible within applied health research projects. I also have a particular interest in the use of methods, such as Framework and qualitative meta-synthesis, that I have argued have greater potential to inform policy and clinical practice.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>My research has been funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, the National Institute for Health Research, the Wellcome Trust, the Sociology of Health and Illness Foundation, and Cancer Research UK.<br \/><br \/><\/p>",

An Integrated Approach to Sustainable Urban Redevelopment: Birmingham Eastside as a National Demonstrator<br \/>Funded by EPSRC<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>Extension to the SUE Scoping Study - a major multidisciplinary research project with Professor Chris Rogers, School of Engineering, UoB; A. Barber, CURS, UoB, J. Sadler, UoB etc two years funding for four Research Fellows, 1 Nov. 2004.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>This research proposal is for an extension to a Sustainable Urban Environment Scoping Study that is exploring the feasibility of adopting Birmingham Eastside as a 'Demonstrator of Sustainable Urban Redevelopment' (GR\/S20482, which employs four Research Fellows, started in May 2003 and will finish in October 2006). The current project is being carried out by researchers from a wide range of academic disciplines (ranging from engineers to environmental geographers) and has its primary focus on the barriers to and enablers of sustainable urban redevelopment. The current study is limited to two contrasting parts of the large Eastside area that is undergoing redevelopment (the Masshouse Area and City Park), but went through the planning stages well before the research project started. By focusing upon two current developments, the existing study has both identified a hierarchy of specific and generic barriers to achieving sustainable urban redevelopment, and highlighted possible ways of overcoming them (i.e. enablers). The most important barrier to achieving sustainability (which is being considered in its broadest sense based around the three social, environmental and economic 'pillars') was identified as the decision-making process, where sustainability either becomes central (or not) to the future of the city. The proposed research will therefore explore the complex issues surrounding the barriers and enablers at the time of decision-making.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p><strong><em>Rediscovering Charitable Enterprises in Economic Geography: The Almshouse Renaissance and the Care of the Elderly and Poor in Urban and Rural Britain<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>Funded by the Nuffield Foundation<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>The transformation of the state welfare system has provided an opportunity for charitable enterprises to play an important role in the economy and society. This project explores their role in the provision of housing and welfare support for the elderly and poor.

The purpose of this research is to develop a constructive critique of the ways in which institutions and organizations construct their histories. The main research interest is understanding the ways in which stories of economic and historical geography are constructed, reconstructed and retold by geographers (Bryson and Lowe, 2001; Bailey and Bryson 2006 a &amp; b).<\/p>",

I am the Principal Investigator of a project on <i>The Earliest Commentaries on Paul as Sources for the Biblical Text<\/i> funded by the European Research Council from 2011 to 2016. I also led the UK contribution to the <i>Workspace for Collaborative Editing<\/i>, an online environment for editing New Testament materials. In recent years, I have identified new witnesses to the earliest Latin translations of the Gospels, worked on the online <i>Codex Sinaiticus<\/i> and <i>Codex Bezae <\/i>and published a study of the evidence for the gospel text used by Augustine. My monograph on <i>The Latin New Testament<\/i> will be published in February 2016. I am one of the convenors of the Birmingham Colloquium on the Textual Criticism of the New Testament and Deputy Director of ITSEE. I am also a Director of the International Patristics Conference, and convenor of the Sixth British Patristics Conference (Birmingham 2016). I supervise PhD students in the field of New Testament textual scholarship.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>My personal website can be found at: <a title=\"http:\/\/sites.google.com\/site\/haghoughton\/\" href=\"http:\/\/sites.google.com\/site\/haghoughton\/\">http:\/\/sites.google.com\/site\/haghoughton\/<\/a><\/p>",

    "Biography": "Dr Anna Phillips was appointed as a research associate during her PhD at the University of Birmingham, and undertook post-doctoral research for one year following her PhD with Prof Douglas Carroll. She then went on to win a prestigious 5-year RCUK Roberts Fellowship which is a fast-track fellowship that segues into a lectureship following its completion. On completion of the fellowship in 2011 she was promoted to Senior Research Fellow, and then again to Reader in Behavioural Medicine in 2012. <br \/> <br \/> She received the Herbert Weiner Early Career Award 2010 from the American Psychosomatic Society - one of only two UK scientists to ever win this award. The award is made in recognition of importance and sophistication of research for this career stage. <br \/> <br \/> Dr Phillips also won the Neal Miller Early Career Award from the Academy of Behavioral Medicine Research 2010 - a very prestigious award to research. In 2011 Dr Phillips became the inaugral winner of the award for outstanding contributions to research from the British Psychological Society Division of Health Psychology. <br \/> <br \/> Dr Phillips&nbsp;is also a Birmingham hero.&nbsp;<a title=\"Dr Anna Phillips&#39; hero profile\" href=\"\/research\/impact\/heroes\/staff\/anna-phillips.aspx\" class=\"sys_0 sys_t1491565\">See&nbsp;Dr Anna Phillips' Birmingham&nbsp;hero profile<\/a>.",

    "Research": "<p class=\"body1\">I am currently a Reader in Behavioural Medicine and Health Psychologist working at the University of Birmingham in the areas of Psychoneuroimmunology, Cardiovascular Psychophysiology, and Behavioural Medicine. I am particularly interested in the impact of stress and other behavioural factors on health via interactions between the cardiovascular, neuroendocrine and immune systems. My main areas of research are: 1) Cardiovascular stress reactivity, where I am developing a new theory of the negative health and behavioural correlates of blunted reactivity, and am engaged in several collaborations on large datasets, particularly showing the importance of the impact of anxiety on health outcomes including mortality and the metabolic syndrome; and 2) Ageing, stress, physical activity, nutrition and effects on health and wellbeing, particularly immunity, where I have been\/am engaged in large grant funded projects to examine the synergistic impact of ageing and psychological and behavioural factors such as stress, depression, and physical activity on indices of immunity and physical frailty.&nbsp; I am now lead of a new European Commission Horizon 2020 Marie Curie Innovative Training Network on Physical Activity and Nutrition Influences iN ageing (PANINI) training 11 Early Stage Researchers with 18 European partners (academic, industry, health and third sector).&nbsp; I am well published in all of these areas in the top journals in my field and see my work developing further along these lines to integrate my knowledge of psychological and behavioural factors (including physical activity), immunity, and cardiovascular and neural reactions to stress to produce an integrative multidisciplinary model of risk of unhealthy ageing.&nbsp;<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p class=\"body1\">With my existing and new collaborators, psychological, physical activity, nutritional, or biomedical interventions will be developed to be applied in individuals identified as at risk, to prevent the progression to frailty and poor physical and emotional health in older age.&nbsp; This integration of the different physiological systems and psychological\/behavioural predictors implicated in healthy ageing, and applying successful multi-level interventions to improve health in later life is my long term research goal.&nbsp; Attached to this goal is the strong desire to maintain public engagement to increase understanding of the discipline as well as to generate impact from my previous and ongoing research.&nbsp;<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p class=\"body1\">I have a strong public engagement profile, particularly in the areas of ageing and stress, and am expanding this to include physical activity in ageing.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>In the video below Dr Phillips describes, in 60 seconds, her research into how stress and depression affects the immune system.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p><iframe src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/DV6H7EkhaUU?rel=0\" height=\"287\" width=\"510\">&nbsp;<\/iframe><\/p>\u000d\u000a<p><a title=\"Dr Anna Phillips video transcript here\" href=\"http:\/\/www.birmingham.ac.uk\/university\/colleges\/les\/research-gallery\/anna-phillips.aspx\">Video transcript here<\/a><\/p>\u000d\u000a<p><strong>Other videos from Dr Anna Phillips<\/strong><\/p>\u000d\u000a<table>\u000d\u000a<tbody>\u000d\u000a<tr>\u000d\u000a<td style=\"width: 250px;\"><iframe src=\"\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/rET1FVi1okY?rel=0\" height=\"141\" width=\"250\">&nbsp;<\/iframe><br \/> Depression after hip fracture hinders recovery<\/td>\u000d\u000a<td style=\"width: 250px;\"><iframe src=\"\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/C2Bfw_pSpkY?rel=0\" height=\"141\" width=\"250\">&nbsp;<\/iframe><br \/> Dr Anna Phillips talks to IdeasLab <br \/> &nbsp;<\/td>\u000d\u000a<\/tr>\u000d\u000a<tr>\u000d\u000a<td style=\"width: 250px;\"><iframe src=\"\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/QNAV_CAw97k?rel=0\" height=\"141\" width=\"250\">&nbsp;<\/iframe><br \/> Hip fracture, depression and the immune system<\/td>\u000d\u000a<td style=\"width: 250px;\"><iframe src=\"\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/p77v8jH2kXk?rel=0\" height=\"141\" width=\"250\">&nbsp;<\/iframe><br \/> The effects of stress of care giving on immunity<\/td>\u000d\u000a<\/tr>\u000d\u000a<tr>\u000d\u000a<td style=\"width: 250px;\"><iframe src=\"\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/MweQNZoZcXY\" height=\"141\" width=\"250\">&nbsp;<\/iframe><br \/> AgeWell Conference 2010<\/td>\u000d\u000a<td style=\"width: 250px;\"><iframe src=\"\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/dAHIWvqHYc8?rel=0\" height=\"141\" width=\"250\">&nbsp;<\/iframe><br \/> Dr Anna Phillips - Birmingham Hero<\/td>\u000d\u000a<\/tr>\u000d\u000a<\/tbody>\u000d\u000a<\/table>\u000d\u000a<p><strong>Podcast<\/strong><\/p>\u000d\u000a<p><a title=\"Stress (MP3 - 17.1MB)\" href=\"\/Audio\/news\/anna-phillips-stress.mp3\" class=\"sys_6\">Listen to Dr Anna Phillips' podcast 'How stress affects our immune systems' (MP3 - 17.1MB).<\/a><\/p>",

Having completed his Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council (AHRC) funded doctoral studies that explored the discourse and theory of the phenomenon here at the University, he has since gone on to develop research that has had social, political and public appeal. As well as appearing regularly in the media, in recent years Chris has worked alongside Government in an advisory capacity. Having submitted both written and oral evidence to the House of Lords Select Committee on Religious Offences and the All Party Parliamentary Group on Islamophobia, Chris also sits as an independent expert on the Cross-Government Working Group on Anti-Muslim Hatred based in the Department for Communities &amp; Local Government.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>In 2010, Ashgate published Chris book entitled <b>\"Islamophobia\".<\/b> With this publication, Chris became the first academic to put forward a full theoretical exposition of Islamophobia whilst establishing a new definition of the phenomenon. Critically acclaimed, Dr Sophie Gilliat-Ray (Director of the Islam-UK Centre, Cardiff University) wrote how the book \"will become a standard work of reference, as well as stimulating future discussion\". Prof Ron Geaves (Liverpool Hope University) noted how the \"book is both timely and relevant and provides the depth of enquiry and investigation needed to deal with a highly contested phenomenon\". Whilst Prof J&oslash;rgen S. Nielsen (Centre for European Islamic Thought, University of Copenhagen) noted how the book made \"a substantial contribution to clearing up much of the confusion around a term which is usually emotionally and politically loaded\".<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>In addition to the monograph, Chris continues to publish on that topic and other key issues facing contemporary Muslim communities in countries as Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, Serbia, Spain and Switzerland. He was also the co-author of the seminal EUMC report into Islamophobia in Europe after 9\/11.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>Before taking up his current post, Chris was the Director of Research and Policy at a Birmingham-based human rights charity, <a title=\"BRAP website\" href=\"http:\/\/www.brap.org.uk\">BRAP<\/a>.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>As well as Islamophobia his other research interests include: the role of faith and religion in the public and political spaces; issues around diversity, multiculturalism and super-diversity; equalities legislation, policy and practice; inclusion, exclusion, integration and cohesion.<\/p>",

    "Biography": "<p>I come from a shopkeeping background and was the first in my family to go to university. I am a beneficiary of state-funded higher education, without which I would have had to leave university and would not have done a doctorate.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>My BA is in early medieval European history, but I got interested in China along the way, and studied modern and classical Chinese in Taiwan in order to do my PhD.&nbsp;<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>I held a Junior Research Fellowship at St John&rsquo;s College, Oxford, where I had my first child, then worked for two years at the University of Wisconsin-Superior, a small, public, liberal arts college, which gave me a crash course in teaching and in engaged scholarship, and where I had my second child<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>In 2000 I participated in a 6-month research group at the Institute for Advanced Study at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, before returning to the UK to take up a lectureship in Chinese history at Newcastle. There I helped to embed World History and to develop East Asian history within the History programme, and to build East Asian Studies across the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences. I became senior lecturer in 2007.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>I came to Birmingham as Professor of Medieval History in 2011, the first non-Europeanist to be appointed to a post of this title (though not the first to hold one).<\/p>",

    "IntroductoryStatement": "<p>I am a medieval historian who works on northern Eurasia in global contexts, with a primary focus on regions that lie within what is now China, North Korea and Mongolia. I work with texts, with archaeologists and with medievalists studying all parts of the globe, and have been particularly interested in borders, frontiers and borderlands and the people who live in and around such places.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>At present my chief concerns are the social and material contexts for political action at all levels, and the question of how to take global approaches to the history of the period c. 300-1500. My current projects embrace historical analysis and archaeological fieldwork on urban sites in Inner Mongolia, and a research network on &lsquo;Defining the Global Middle Ages&rsquo;. I am writing a global history of eastern Eurasia between the 7th and the 14th centuries.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>Since I am both a historian and an Area Studies specialist, I have always felt that China people needed to pay more attention to History and History people needed to pay more attention to China. My work uses the methods and approaches of the early medievalist, while at the same time I strive for greater recognition for China within the discipline of history. These inclinations are currently finding their natural outlet in my contribution to efforts to globalise medieval studies.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>I am also active in the field of Chinese studies in the UK and abroad, where I have worked for many years to foster the development of pathways into the study of China and the necessary acquisition of Chinese language that do not rely on taking an undergraduate degree in Chinese, and to emphasise the importance of strong disciplinary training alongside language acquisition.<\/p>",

These are large programmes with a total of 308 students from 14 different countries following either the MA in Applied Linguistics or the MA in TESOL. Our distance programmes allow practicing expatiate teachers of English as a Foreign Language (TEFL) to study for an MA while they are working abroad (e.g. in Korea, Japan, Brazil, Switzerland, Saudi Arabia etc.). The majority of our students are mature and come from Canada, America, the United Kingdom and Australia.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<h3>External Examiner University of Warwick 2011-2014<\/h3>\u000d\u000a<p>During the last 4 years I have been working for the University of Warwick as an External Examiner for their Higher Education Foundation Programme.

This research seeks to analyse how images of contemporary Germany are constructed &ldquo;from the outside&rdquo; in the areas of economics, politics, education, history and culture.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>Dr Jones&nbsp;is&nbsp;currently developing a new comparative project looking at how memories of dictatorship are negotiated across borders in political, cultural and social processes. She is particularly interested in the intersections between transitional justice and memory studies and the function of memorialisation in processes of reconciliation.<\/p>",

    "Biography": "<p>Catherine Needham graduated from the University of Leeds in 1996, and worked for political strategist Philip Gould prior to undertaking an MSc (1999) and DPhil (2004) at Nuffield College, Oxford. She worked in the School of Politics and International Relations at Queen Mary, University of London from 2003 to 2012. She joined the University of Birmingham in 2012 as a Senior Lecturer in Public Policy and Public Management.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>Catherine&rsquo;s research focuses on reform of&nbsp;public services, with particular emphasis on the introduction of consumerist models of service delivery. She is interested in the relative role of quasi-markets and consumer-centred models of decision-making compared to those based on notions of citizenship and publicness. Taking an interpretive approach to policy analysis, she has examined the different &lsquo;narratives of consumerism' contained within recent welfare reforms in the UK , drawing on content analysis of government documents and interviews with policy makers, service users and staff.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>Her most recent work has focused on the personalisation of public services, with a particular interest in social care services, examining the relationship between the meta-narrative of personalisation and the frontline practice of service redesign. She is also interested in individualised budgets within public services, and the dynamics through which they reshape service provision. She is also exploring how policy ideas and mechanisms spread across different service sectors, using theories of policy transfer and translation.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>Catherine is currently working on a range of research projects to explore the implications of personalisation and co-production for public service delivery. She has collaborated with the Public Policy and Management Association and the Centre for Public Service Partnerships on a project on commissioning for personalisation In the past she has worked on projects on innovation and accountability in secondary education (with NASUWT) and enhancing local performance management (with the National Consumer Council and Unison). She has also worked with the Local Authorities Research Council Initiative on a project on co-productive approaches to local service delivery.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>Catherine also has an interest in political communication and marketing. She has incorporated concepts such as relationship marketing, branding and policy transfer into the study of political communications,&nbsp;and applied them to comparative studies of the UK and USA .<\/p>",

Formerly, she was Head of the Department of Sport Pedagogy and prior to that she held a Chair in the School of Sport, Exercise and Health Sciences at Loughborough University. Her main research interest is career-long professional learning for teachers and coaches and its impact on young people's learning in physical education and sport. <br \/> <br \/> Kathy&rsquo;s current research interests centre on finding new ways to bridge persistent theory\/research-practice gaps in order to benefit both practice and research in pedagogy. Over the last six years, Kathy has been PI and CoI on numerous funded projects including an analysis of implicit and explicit learning theories underpinning the design of coach education (funded by the FA); a European project examining the barriers to physical activity for the least active young people in society (funded by the Coca Cola Foundation) and an analysis of the capacity of volunteer sports coaches as community assets (funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council). In addition to over fifty peer-reviewed journal papers and book chapters, Kathy has recently published three books. The first is an &lsquo;Introduction to Sport Pedagogy&rsquo; for undergraduate students who are planning to develop careers in teaching or coaching; the second is a &lsquo;Research Methods&rsquo; text to support students as they prepare dissertations in the fields of physical education and youth sport; the third is an innovative book of interdisciplinary &lsquo;pedagogical cases&rsquo; of children and young people and their learning in physical activity and sport. She is currently working on a new book of pedagogical cases focussed on technology-enhanced learning in physical education (available from early 2016).<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>Kathy is a Fellow of the Academy of Social Sciences in the UK, an International Fellow of the National Academy of Kinesiology in the USA, and was an academic assessor for the field of Sport and Exercise Sciences, Leisure and Tourism in the most recent national assessment of research quality (REF2014).&nbsp;<\/p>",

    "Biography": "Before joining TSRC James was a researcher at the Institute for Economic Governance at the University of Manchester. He completed his PhD entitled &lsquo;Housing Market Renewal: Gentrification or Mixed Sustainable Communities?&rsquo; at Manchester in 2007. Prior to that he was a research assistant at the Centre for Urban Policy Studies, also at the University of Manchester. He has researched extensively on sub-national governance in work funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), Department for Communities and Local Government (CLG) and the European Commission (ESPON); and by other public bodies such as the Northern Way and Manchester City Council. He has a track record of research on communities, neighbourhoods and the voluntary and community sector, including the national evaluation of New Deal for Communities (for ODPM), evaluation of community contracts (CLG), voluntary sector delivery of public services and their role in tackling worklessness (for North West regional bodies), and on housing policy, practice and equalities for the Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC). More recently he has completed research projects funded by the AHRC Connected Communities programme; and is currently involved in contract research funded by the Ministry of Justice and New Philanthropy Capital.",

    "Research": "<p>Sue's primary research interest is in the sociological analysis of professional judgement and&nbsp; decision-making with an emphasis on understanding how science, formal knowledge, rhetoric, moral judgement, emotion and subjectivity interact in professional practice, particularly in child health and welfare. Her research has focused principally on the analysis of professional talk in a range of health and welfare settings. However, she has also undertaken evaluative and applied research for central and local government, NHS and non-statutory organizations. Sue's most recent Economic and Social Research Council projects, 2004-2006 (Tracking Children and Accomplishing Risk: e-Assessment Systems in Child Welfare, ESRC e-Society Programme, graded Outstanding) and 2006-2009 (Error Blame and Responsibility: The Problematics of Governance in an Invisible Trade, ESRC Public Services Programme, graded Outstanding) have been influential in informing policy developments and the reform of social work. They have also aroused her interest in socio-technical systems design.

    "Research": "<p>My general research areas are Dada and Surrealism in French literature and film.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>My most recent book is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.legendabooks.com\/titles\/isbn\/9781907975837.html\"><em>Dada as Text, Thought and Theory<\/em><\/a> (Oxford: Legenda Research Monographs in French Studies, 2015). Arguing for a significant reappraisal of one of the twentieth-century's most prominent cultural movements, the study combines close textual analysis and Dada history to approach topics either ignored or resisted by most traditional criticism, including women Dada poets, psychoanalysis and madness, and the history of ideas, including Buddhism and quantum physics.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>Over 2014 I worked with <a href=\"http:\/\/staffprofiles.humanities.manchester.ac.uk\/Profile.aspx?Id=saskia.warren\">Saskia Warren<\/a> on a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.culturalintermediation.org.uk\/\">feasbility study<\/a> into a heritage space related to the Birmingham Surrealist group led by Conroy Maddox. The project was funded by the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.communitiesandculture.org\/\">Communities and Culture Network+<\/a> and involved workshops and a round table as part of a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.birmingham.ac.uk\/schools\/lcahm\/departments\/languages\/sections\/french\/research\/surrealist-laboratory.aspx\">Birmingham Surrealist Laboratory<\/a>.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>I am also interested in Dada and Surrealism as part of a tradition of experimental or (would be) 'radical' French culture. With my colleague <a href=\"http:\/\/www.birmingham.ac.uk\/staff\/profiles\/french\/wagstaff-emma.aspx\">Emma Wagstaff<\/a> I co-edited a special issue of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.euppublishing.com\/toc\/nfs\/50\/3\"><em>Nottingham French Studies<\/em><\/a> (2011) on the French avant-garde, in the aim of expanding the periodisation and scope of the avant-garde canon, as well as the methods used to understand individual authors and bodies of work. My other published research in this area considers French avant-garde work from the 1920s and 1930s within a variety of contexts, including European cultural and intellectual responses to armed conflict, combat testimony from soldiers, modern geo-politics and the (so-called) 'so-called 'war on terror'', and the politics and commodification of avant-garde art. I have also drawn on Dada and Surrealism in looking at collaborative experimental work produced on film and video by Jean-Luc Godard and Anne-Marie Mi&eacute;ville in the 1970s and 1980s.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>My monograph on Tristan Tzara (1896-1963) - <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mhra.org.uk\/cgi-bin\/legenda\/legenda.pl?catalogue=b1904713149\"><em>Modernist Song: The Poetry of Tristan Tzara<\/em><\/a> (Oxford: Legenda, 2006) - represents the first book-length study of poetry written by the man remembered popularly as 'the Father of Dada', whose life in literature continued for nearly four decades after the totemic <em>Sept manifestes Dada<\/em> of 1924. I have continued to research various aspects of Tzara's life and writing, and am working on a long-term project to bring together Tzara's post-WII poetry - which was illustrated by Sonia Delaunay, Matisse, Mir&oacute; and Picasso, among others - in a critical edition.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>I have corresponded with galleries, cultural organisations and researchers about the various research topics described here, and it is always a pleasure to hear from colleagues or students working in related areas. I am very happy to discuss possible supervision or collaboration, or to respond to questions about any aspect of my work.<\/p>",

This research uses diagnostic interviews, neuropsychological and neuroendocrine experiments, and magnetic resonance imaging on over 1800 children and adolescents across seven European countries to examine why disruptive behaviour is more common in males than females.<\/p>\u000d\u000a<p>A second strand of his research interests is to better understand patterns of resilience and vulnerability in children and adults who have experienced early adversity.
